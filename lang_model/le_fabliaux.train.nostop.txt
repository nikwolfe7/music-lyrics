i'll lay some cushions out 100 make soft comfy bed
as trust saint paul what you've said right proper says priest
since you've advised this not least will he perturb anymore
105 wasnt all long before bishop made trip went off town there he spent an entire week only then did he return back home again
110 there town woman dwelt whom am'rous bishop felt great love
without fail every night he went lie down by her side she'd not go him whatever 115 pledges he'd make or gifts he'd give her she was so very proud vain acted toward him disdain
at length one night seems they had agreed she he 120 would bed down lie each other but priest was quick discover all details what they'd plotted being sad heavyhearted because bishop had said him 125 he may not live woman memory him still he affirms not anything will prevent him from going speak woman
he went seek 130 her out straightaway he said lady may god come aid assistance would much avail
careful do not fail or i'll no longer friend
what service do want provided lady i've no intent hide 140 priest says

he hides himself concealed behind bed curtains which make blind him stays till day has set when bishop did not forget 160 where was he's supposed go
cant think what more needs said except bedding was turned down all curtains tightly drawn two glowing candles alight filling bedroom their light
170 lady was first climb into bed no time wasted bishop got her his penis starting grow stiffer her unclothed him beside her
175 he cannot wait mount ride her but she will not allow him do anything he wants do
father she tells him not so fast

he said ma'am by faith owe 195 what want will bestow
ask agree
over her cunt bishop made sign cross then said 200 benedico
per omnia seculorum secula
as priest hiding when he heard him he chimed amen as soon as bishop heard 205 him—you can sure he was scared by rejoinder priest made— he raised his voice bit said who who made reply grace he said wretch am 210 whose wife you'd take away from him only because whim also one whom forbade drink wine have obeyed
today heard information 215 you'd perform an ordination
i'd witness thought
bishop heartily guffawed said laid trap caught by trickery
220 henceforth give permission drink wine eat peppered chicken dine goose as much as would keep woman too
just keep well out sight
225 off goes priest great delight
three estates two knights go riding their way piebald dapple gray stumble an open space among trees shady place decked flowers herbs as well
they stopped rested there spell
one them said by god swear how fine have picnic here you'd need only jug wine pasties things which dine 10 feast would at least as gay as great hall high dais
then they have moving
two wandering scholars out fun came by saw lovely scene
15 speaking as clerics do between themselves one said who got spend some time here lady friend would spend her pleasantly
other said he'd have 20 weak hearted easily daunted not get everything he wanted
but they could stay no longer then
two peasants then came barging
when they had sat down pleasance they started speaking just peasants hey fouchier from looks this perfect place shit
30 let's take dump right now old pal
upon soul may as well
then each them squats down strains
this story patently explains there's nothing earth as pleasant 35 as taking shit peasant therefore peasant befouls fairest spots moves his bowels there delight recreation so light obligation 40 those good folk what propose peasants go shit through their noses
peasant whatever say one whose heart makes him way whose deeds show his vulgarity 45 however high his ancestry
god turn our steps from infamy save present company
empty
trollops troupers when god first made filled earth people throughout its girth all creatures belong there then he set up three orders men live earth by his decree 5 clergy knights peasantry
he gave rights own govern knights clergy tithes alms last all he gave farms 10 peasants sown tilled thereupon his task fulfilled he left his creatures withdrew
as he was leaving into view there came profligates hordes 15 entertainers bawds
he'd not gone far when they approached him began cry out reproached him where are going lord do say word us dont leave us stay 20 we're given nothing are slighted though others you've provided
hearing them our heavenly sire looked them deigned inquire saint peter who's standing near 25 about those people over there
he answered they're surly race also created through grace
those who place their trust they're clamoring them too 30 see fit make some provision
our lord corrected omission but spoke no word them instead he went straight knights said lords whom gave all lands 35 rule now place hands entertainers as charge live among entourage
generous openhanded them god command 40 do not treat them disdain
clergy shall maintain harlots under protection accordance direction
contrariwise fable teaches 50 if have understood well as knights they'll go hell
they look scorn performers who must live poorer than dormouse go about without pair 55 shoes while whores get furs wear well lined cloaks fine attire
entertainers their hire get little enough their lords
all their fine noble words 60 they give them only worn out garments toss them as they would varmints their fine dinners scraps messes while harlots often change their dresses sleep their priests what they're fed 65 counted overhead
priests do this their souls' sake whereas stingy knights forsake entertainers are damned violating god's command
70 not so priestly class because they're generous serve their whores their actions are evidence
they lay out inheritance wealth christ crucified 75 keeping their mistresses supplied out their rents tithes donations merit our congratulations above all others this act
if what fable tells fact 80 clergy assured salvation knights will go damnation
