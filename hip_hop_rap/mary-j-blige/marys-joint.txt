oh, no no no... 

Vs.1
I know 
That you're just a man 
But you're all the man I need 
And I know 
That you care and you'll never leave 
No, you'll never leave 

Chorus
I love you so 
I can't let go 
You know it's real 
The way I feel 
I want to stay 
I'll try to wait 
On you my dear 
My love's sincere 

Vs.2
You promised 
That you never would cheat or lie 
Lie to me, don't lie to me babe 
And you promised 
That you'd trust and believe in me 
Please believe in me 

Unnecessary pain pain is pain 
Now tell me who would get the pain 
You know it hurts 
If we should go astray 
What would we do 
What would we say

Let's build our love 
Stronger than it ever was
