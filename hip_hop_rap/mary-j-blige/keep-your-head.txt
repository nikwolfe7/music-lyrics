Vs.1
The day seems so very long 
But I'm trying to be strong 
Trying to be strong 
Well, hold on, I say 
Things will soon turn my way 
And then I'll have a clear view 
But I gotta keep 

Chorus
Keep your head to the sky 
I don't need to tell you why 
Keep your head to the sky 
I don't need to tell you why 

Vs.2
I sometimes get worried 
And I wonder why I worry 
Cause I know that I will make it through the storm 
I'm tryin not to lose my cool 
Because if in this world I do 
The only person that's gonna miss out on everything is me 
And I gotta keep 

Chorus

oooh, ooh 
oh, ooh, oh 
Keep your head up 
Don't you look down for nobody 
Don't you do it, don't you do it 
Keep your head 

Chorus
Everyday's a struggle 
But struggling to be 
Is very hard, so very hard 
Because I'm out here trying to do the right thing 
And when I look around here's the wrong thing 
Tempting me to make me disagree 
About how I feel about me 
But I gotta keep 

Chorus
