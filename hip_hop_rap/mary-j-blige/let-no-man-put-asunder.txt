I'm surprised to see your suitcase at the door
Remember the good times, don't you want some more
It's not a perfect love, but I'll defend it
Cause I believe that's what God intended

[1] - We got love too good to throw away

[2] - It's not over between you and me
It's not over, don't want to be free

[3] - What has been joined by God, by God
Let no man put asunder
Oh no don't throw it away
Don't throw it away

I can hear those words spoken, understood
Making bonds through love, the times are better good
I'm convinced that what is meant to be will be
Even the stars declare that you belong to me

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 2]
[Repeat 3]

Hmmm, oh, oh, oh yeah

[Repeat 2 2x]

It's not over
Said I need you
And I want you
I got to have you every day in my dog gone life
It's not over
It's not over, no, no, no
It's not over
It's not over
It's not over
Said I need you
And I want you
I got to have you every day in my dog gone life
It's not over
It's not over, no, no, no
It's not over
It's not over
Baby, baby, baby, oh, hmm, hmm

See, one thing I know about me and you
That no matter what we go through baby
I know you will be coming back someday
Because I know deep inside you feel the same way
Because it's not over
It's not over, no, no, between you and me
It's not over, hmmm na
Say ooh baby, ooh baby
Come on y'all, help me out, come on y'all
You know what I'm saying, yeah
It's not over, no, no, between you and me
Come on ya'll
Baby, baby, baby
It's not over
