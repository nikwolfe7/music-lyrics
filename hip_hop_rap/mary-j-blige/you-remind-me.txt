Oooh you remind me, yeah 
you remind me of such sweet memories 

Chorus
I saw you before baby 
It's a deja~vu honey 
don't you know that you remind me 

I saw you before baby 
It's a deja~vu honey 
Don't you know that you remind me 

Vs.1
You, you remind me of a love that I once knew 
Is it a dream or is it deja~vu 
I just had to let you know so I had to sing it 
'cause for you boy I don't know 

The way you walk and the way you talk and 
the way you move and you remind me, yes you do 
Of the way you dress and the way you dance and 
you really like to move it. You remind me 

Chorus

Vs.2
You, you remind me of a memory 
and this is something you should know 
Sweet baby darling c'mon just stop playing with my mind 
'cause for you boy I don't know 

The way 
The way you walk and 
The way 
The way you talk and 
The way 
You really like to move it 
The way 
The way you dress and 
The way 
The way you dance and 
The way 
You really like to groove it 
You remind me, you remind me 

Chorus

Keyboard plays 

And the way you walk and 
the way you talk and 
the way you move it 
You remind me, yes you do 
The way you dress and 
the way you dance and 
you really like to groove it 
You remind me, you remind me 

Chorus
I saw you, I saw you before baby 
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
