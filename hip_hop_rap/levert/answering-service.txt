Hello this is Angela 
I'm sorry I'm unable 
To answer this call right now 
So please at the sound 
of the beep 

Leave your name and number 
And I will contact you 
As soon as possible 

I know you're there baby 
It just ain't right 
The way you're treating me 
I wish you would listen, and 

Open up and try to undersatnd 
How I feel, I miss you 
I love you and I just want 
you to know 
I'll always be there for you 

Chorus 

I love you hope you get 
this message 
I don't deserve this talking 
to you answering service 
I need you hope you 
get this message 
I don't deserve this talking 
to your answering service 

Girl I know that I hurt you 
and I apologize 
But I would feel so much better 
If I could look into those big brown eyes

Is there a pleasure you get 
In making me suffer like this oh 
I just wanna hear you say 

Hear you say I love you 
Girl that's what I really miss 
Why you wanna treat me like this 

Chorus 

I know your girlfriends are there listening 
But I don't really give a damn no 
And you might have a man around 

But baby I know I'm your only 
I'm your one and only man 
And I wantcha to know that 

Chorus 

I know I really hurt you deep 
But since then I haven't been able to sleep 
Can't you just forgive an forget but I

'Cause you ain't picked up the phone yet

Can't you see I'm crying baby 
I know you hear me baby 
Talking to your answering service

And I don't give a damn if your friends is

So why don't you pick up the phone 
And call me up 'cause without you girl 
Life is too damn tough too damn tough 

Chorus 

I don't care who knows 
I don't care who knows 
How I feel about you baby 
Life is too damn tough 
Said why don't you pick up the phone
