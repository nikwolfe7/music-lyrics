There comes a time in a man's life 
When he's tired of the games messing 
around 
He needs a good woman to settle down 
And I'm at that time in my life 
And I found what I needed in you 

I swear I'll always be true 
After searching and searching and 
searching 
What treasure I found in you 
So baby I'm ready say you'll be my lady 
And I'll give my all to you 

Chorus 
I just can't help myself 
I'll tell the world I love you I love you 
I don't want no one else 
I just can't help myself 

Chorus 

I want us to have a family 
A girl for you a boy for me 
A great big old house 
Baby just wait and see 
I know you're wondering if I'm serious 

Oh girl it's for real this feeling I feel 
Do me a favor girl give me your trust 
I've had time to think it over 
And if you think that I'm letting you go 
Baby you must be crazy I'm gonna let you 
know 

Repeat Chorus two times 

I ain't trying to find nobody 
To take the place of you 
'Cause there is no other girl 
In the whole wide world 
Who can do the things that you do 

Oh baby I'll run around tellin all my 
friends 
That I'll never find another like you again 
I just can't help myself 
And I don't wanna help myself 

Repeat chorus two times
