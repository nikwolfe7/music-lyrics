Gotta break it on down
Gotta break it on down

I'm gonna be right there for you
Whenever you need me my boo

Never thought I'd know such pleasure
Never thought I'd come to feel
Tenderness of your touch
Sweet taste of your love
The sexiness of your appeal
When you smiled I saw angels
And all my worries disappeared
You looked at me with your heart
Blessed me with your wonder
And heard my future in your ear

1 - So wherever you run
That's where I'll go
However you glide
That's how I'll go
Wherever you shine
That's when I'll go
It don't matter the time, baby
That's where I'll go

It was like a trip to heaven yeah
A fantasy come true
There is no greater wonder
A spell you got me under
Whatever you ask of me I'll do
