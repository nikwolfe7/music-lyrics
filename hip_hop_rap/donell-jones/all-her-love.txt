She's got a man, another situation 
I understand that's how it's got to be 
Ain't trying to cause her no complications 
I'd walk away but I'm in too deep 

1 - I can't make no plans, got me so frustrated 
Cause in my heart I want you desperately 
Done ran away from all the girls I've been dating 
When I'm with them, it's only you I see 
And she promised me that it would take some time 
But she would leave him alone 
And the thought of her loving only me 
That's the thing that keeps me strong 

2 - She gives me all her love 
But only half the time 
Still it's more than enough 
To keep my hope alive 

Just yesterday I saw them shopping at the mall 
Looked like she tried on a diamond ring 
The way he held her down, it drove me crazy 
Spent half the day wishing that it was me 

Repeat 1 

Repeat 2 

A secret rendezvous, just to spend time with you 
Girl I need you in my life 
And if I had to choose, the thought would still be you 
Just as long as she give me all her love 

Repeat 2 

She gives me all her love 
And it's enough for me cause I'm never gonna leave, and 
She gives me all love 
And it's enough for me cause I'm never gonna leave, and 
Ooh said I'm never gonna leave 
I've been getting all your love, half the time, oh no 

Repeat 2 

Ooh na, na, na, na, na, na 
Ooh na, na, na, na, na, na 
Ooh na, na, na, na, na, na 
Ooh na, na, na, na, na, na
