If I lace you, would you lace me back
If I blaze you, would you blaze me back
Spending big faces on the things you like
When ya gonna put me down

If I ride for you, die for you
If I floss at any cost for you
Shorty, all I wanna know from you
Is when ya gonna put me down

First time I saw you, I was breathless
Looking flawless, fifty on the neclace
And I had to add you to my guest list
Let you pass, I had to put it down
We sipped and kicked a little convo'
It's time to head back to the condo
And I know what we both came here for
Let me know what you're feeling now

Do you want to open up and show me your love
Stop playing around and puttin' me down
Stop holding back, you gotta react
When ya gonna hold me down

You're perking, plus we're working
All this flirting got me hurting
When you know I don't deserve this girl
Why ya gonna hold me down

If I lace you, would you lace me back
If I blaze you, would you blaze me back
Spending big faces on the things you like
When ya gonna put me down

Shorty I'm not trying to put a rush on you
Can't keep leavin' me with my love on blue
Nobody's here, we better make our move
I want to get into you

You won't have to floss, I wanna cop that
Frontin' on my love, now shorty stop that
What's it gonna be
When are we gonna put it down
I need to know right now

Do you want to open up and show me your love
Stop playing around and puttin' me down
Stop holding back, you gotta react
When ya gonna hold me down

If I lace you, would you lace me back
If I blaze you, would you blaze me back
Spending big faces on the things you like
When ya gonna put me down

On the top floor in the president's suite
Hit the tinted windows in the back of my jeep
Or your friend's house on the living room couch
If you let me hit it, I'mma blaze it out

Won't cha open up, let me come on in
And I'll never stop, we can do it again
Cuz you take it right where I wanna be 
You got me in ecstasy

I wanna know
I gotta know when you're gonna let me see it
When you gon' let me hit it
Cuz girl you know I'm gonna get it

I wanna know
I gotta know when you're gonna let me see it
When you gon' let me hit it
Cuz girl you know I'm gonna get it

If I lace you, would you lace me back
If I blaze you, would you blaze me back
Spending big faces on the things you like
When ya gonna put me down

If I lace you, would you lace me back
If I blaze you, would you blaze me back
Spending big faces on the things you like
When ya gonna put me down

I wanna know
I gotta know when you're gonna let me see it
When you gon' let me hit it
Cuz girl you know I'm gonna get it

I gotta know
If you're spending my dough
I gotta know
Spending my dough
