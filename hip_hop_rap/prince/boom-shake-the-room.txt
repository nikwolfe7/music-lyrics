and I f-fumble every word for word I utter
so I just try to ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chill 
but it gets worse-a but worse-a but-but-but worse still
I need the c-c-c-crowd to k-k-k-kick it to me
they help me calm down and I can get through it
so higher higher

mic in a strangle hold sweat pourin'
and like Jordan yo I'm scoring

I came here tonight to here the crowd go
Chorus
