Come on out 
Come on out in the sunshine, baby 
Come on out and trust yourself 
Come on out 
Come on out in the sunshine, baby 
And put your blues up on a shelf 

I just wanna wrap my arms around you 
But I would never hold you down 
I been waitin on the day I see you kick some dust up off the ground 
And you step out of the shadows, yeah 
You're gonna step out of the shadows 
When you step out of the shadows 
You're gonna walk in glory 

Come on out 
Come on out of the darkness, baby 
Show the beauty in your soul 
Feel your heart 
Feel your heart pounding, yeah 
Let the rhythm and the breath of life unfold 

I just wanna wrap my arms around you 
But I would never hold you back 
Come on, c'mon, c'mon you've got to cut yourself some slack 
And you step out of the shadows 
You step out of the shadows 
When you step out of the shadows 
You're gonna walk in glory 

And all you really need is what you've got right now 
Shine your light and tell your story 
All God's children 
Gonna walk in glory 
Yeah, walk in glory 

I'm just gonna wrap my arms around you 
And I will never hold you back 
Every little dream has got a string attached 
And you step out of the shadows 
You step out of the shadows 
When you step out of the shadows 
You're gonna walk in glory 

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon now baby 
Walk in glory 
Ooh ooh 

I just wanna wrap my arms around you 
But I will never hold you down 
I been waitin all day to see you kick some dust up off the ground 
And you step out of the shadows 
Gonna step out of the shadows 
When you step out of the shadows 
Gonna walk in glory 

Yeah yeah 
Walk in glory 
No oh oh oh oh 
Walk in glory ooh ooh 
Walk in glory
