Written by Desmond Child

How's it feel to be a woman
How's it feel to be a man
Are we really that different
Tell me where you stand
I look at you, you look away
Why do you say we're night and day
I'd like to try another way
Oh baby for just one day

If you were a woman and I was a man
Would it be so hard to understand
That a heart to heart and we do what we can
If you were a woman and I was a man
If you were a woman and I was a man

How's it feel to be the hunter
How's it feel to be the prey
Is there really a reason
For this game we play
I look at you, you look away
Why do you say we're night and day
I'd like to try another way
Oh darling, just one day

If you were a woman and I was a man
Would it be so hard to understand
That a heart to heart and we do what we can
If you were a woman and I was a man
If you were a woman and I was a man

INSTRUMENTAL

Hey, we're just two people trying to love
Oh but how, how can we love
With this wall between us, holding us back

If you were a woman and I was a man
Would it be so hard to understand
That a heart to heart and we do what we can
If you were a woman and I was a man
If you were a woman and I was a man
