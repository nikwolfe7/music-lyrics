When the sun is burning out
And the night is pouring in
Now is the time to run, run boy
Now is the time to hide

There's nobody out on the beach
There's nobody down in the woods
We're gonna do it alone
We're gonna do it outside-

And I can feel the air it's sticking to out skin so tight
And I can feel there's something in this air tonight-
- I really go it bad
Tonight I really got it bad
Tonight I really got it bad
But it's still so good, so good
That I got it at all and it was

Ravishing, ravishing
And I love to see the moonlight 
See it shimmer down my dress
It's so ravishing, ravishing
And the wind is like a finger 
Tracing patterns on your chest
You're so ravishing

And I know
This is the season that we make our move
This is the season we've got something to prove
And this is the season I've got something to lose
Oh, it's now or it's never
So now and forever, we're

Ravishing, ravishing
Oh-wo-wo
Ravishing, ravishing
Oh-wo-wo
Ravishing, ravishing
Oh-wo-wo

It's all right
We'll be ravishing each other till the end of this endless night
It's all right, so right, it's all right , so right

And if an angel broke his wings
Would he come to you for parts
I need a couple of wings boy, boy
I need a reason to soar

And if the devil lost his fire
Could he count on you for sparks?
There's something we ought to try now
We ought to try it some more-

Than anything I ever wanted was to see the light
and there's a chance that we'll be glowing in the dark tonight-

I really got it bad
Tonight I really got it bad
Tonight I really got it bad
But it still felt good- so good-
-Just to get it at all, and it's so

Ravishing, ravishing
_And I can't believe the way the stars are shooting through your hair
You're so ravishing, ravishing
And it's just my luck tonight I don't have anything to wear
We're so ravishing

This is the season that we make our move
This is the season we've got something to prove
This is the season I've got something to lose
And all we ever really needed was

Ravishing, ravishing
Oh-wo-woo
Ravishing, ravishing
Oh-wo-wo
Ravishing ravishing
Oh-wo-wo

It's all right
We'll be ravishing each other till the end of this endless night
It's all right, so right, it's all right, so right
