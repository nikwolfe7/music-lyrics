Written by and sung with Frankie Miller

Such a long time ago
Now I know
You've woke up to find
You were wrong 
There ain't no doubt
Put me out
Nearly made me blind

You sent me a letter, brought tears to my eyes
Tell me you've changed, after all this time
Like a stone rolling sown the mountainside
It's over, you can't turn the tide, and it's...

CHORUS:
Tears falling about love, falling without love
Tears falling about love, falling without love

I was glad
To be with you
Near to you
My heart can't deny
I was sad
To leave your side
Stripped of pride
When you said goodbye
For every new road there must be a friend
For every broken heart there must be a mend
And the rain only lasted so long
It's over, the thing we had is gone, and it's...

CHORUS-INSTRUMENTAL

To tell me you've changed brought tears to my eyes
Say you've rearranged after all this time
Like a stone rolling down the mountainside
It's over, you can't turn the tide, and it's...

CHORUS - REPEAT AND FADE
