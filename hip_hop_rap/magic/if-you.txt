If you don't know
What you want 
Don't leave me alone tonight 
If you don't go 
I'll let you 
What there is 
In my heart 

If you don't know 
Ah-aaaah 
Ah-aaaah, tonight 
I need your sunshine, tonight 

If you don't know, 
What you're for me, 
Don't leave me alone tonight, 
If you don't go, 
I'll let you see, 
What there is in my heart,
If you say 'no'
I'll feel alone,
I need your sunshine, tonight 
If you stay on, 
I'll give my all, 
I'll be your star 

If you love me, if you love me now, 
I'll be your star
If you love me, if you love me now, 
I'll be your star
If you love me, if you love me now, 
I'll be your star
If you love me, if you love me now, 
I'll be your star

Ah-aaaah 
Ah-aaaah, tonight 
I need your sunshine, tonight

If you want love, 
Then come with me
Stay by my side tonight
If you want love, 
I'll make you rise,
like the moon in the night
If you say 'no'
I'll feel alone, 
I need your sunshine, tonight 
If you stay on, 
I'll give my all, 
I'll be your star

If you love me, if you love me now, 
I'll be your star
If you love me, if you love me now, 
I'll be your star
If you love me, if you love me now,
I'll be your star
If you love me, if you love me now,
I'll be your star

Ah-aaaah 
Ah-aaaah, tonight 
I need your sunshine, tonight 

Ah...
