This game right here is rough as fuck
These ho's out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And in five beers I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through they run and duck
We still right here so what the fuck

[W.C.]
Nigga I'm tired of these niggas barking at shit talkin 'bout shit
From the concrete when they chalkin' like this
And there he goes and a trick pose and a throw back
Holdin' a gat ain't gonna bust and know that
It's a dub ass C thang dub C brain
And we don't kick it but bust it and kaki jeans strains
I'm done movin I'm clearin the crowd
It's the who bangin bandana cri-mi-ni-mi-nal
The ori-gi-nal

[Mack 10]
Evacuate the building look here come a plane
No, it's the big bad Westside Connect Gang
And bump what you claim, homey this who bang
With enough game to drive a swear broad insane
And we number one gunners no we ain't stunners
It's real with us partna, dealers and drug runners
And Mack need a D-board in a H2 Hummer
Lookin hotter than the South Central L.A. summer
Let's go

What the hell is Ice Cube talkin about
That's how you get these here parked in you mouth
Westside ride trick, the same old spit
I don't conversate with chicks I ain't gon' hit
I don't holla at these hoes that sing like Ashanti
Body like Beyonce, face like Andre uhhh
You kinda strange
But I'm with so my entree got to be bombay

[W.C.]
Have you seen us, naw
Haters can't see us
Connect Gang we the G'est nigga
Countless calls and countless charges
Street niggas makin blunts out of Cuban cigars
Big by the linnas sip notic by the liters
With a flock of pros on us cause the cronic is the greenest
And to my G's incarcerated and on probation
I'ma stay bagin for the whole G Nation nigga

It's a Gangsta Nation if you in you a G
And the whole world influence by the b in the sea
Now tell the truth rappers you don't bow like me
Cause I'm really from the gang ya'll is industry
And while I'm servin up and comin young hustlas and gluckas
Bangin for the hood causin havic and ruckus
You fools actin label kissin up like suckas
And your trick solder down when you pee lil bustas

[Ice Cube]
One thing I do know I ain't the uno
Big puno rap sumo on pruno you know
I'd like to thank the congregation
In my affiliation to the Gangsta Nation
I'm hard on them, yeah I'm ruthless
You like a stress sac, boy you useless
You know the side trick, better get up on it
Cause it must be a single with Nate Dogg singin on it

[Mack 10]
Look check this out man
We got a Gangsta Nation goin down over here
So ya'll might as well bow down
And join this Westside thang man
Cause once you get with this
Partna you as G as can be

Fred Red, what I'd tell you homey
It ain't a hit till Nate Dogg spit
