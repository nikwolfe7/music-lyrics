I'm sorry I forsake you
I'm sorry that I left you
I'm sorry I did forget you
And I'm sorry that I made myself feel better
By making you feel never good enough
I know you'll shine much brighter than I ever could
Maybe that is why I was

[Chorus:]
Scared of you and in everything I do I'm still thinking of you oh, you
And I know you were scared of me 
but everytime I tried to love you I just fell through too

Desculpa-me se te-ofendi
Desculpa-me se te-esqueci
Desculpa me se-eu te-deixei
Eu te-deixei
E desculpa-me por mi sintir bem com tua dor
Sabes que te-adore mais sei que tu estrela a maior do que minha, 
do que minha
E por isso

[Chorus:]
Eu tenho medo deste amor os dias passo pensando en ti amor
Medo deste amor Salve-me porque agora estou caindo amor

Scared of you I was
Scared of you I was
Scared of you
Scared of you
Scared of you
