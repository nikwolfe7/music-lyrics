Well, well, what do I say 
Looks like what goes around comes around 
And everyone will have their final say 
Sometime, someday 
Looks like I only love God when the sun shines my way 
Looks like I'm into divinity only when I can see its sweet, sweet rays

[Chorus:]
I say what I mean but I don't mean what I say 
Well, well, it's fine out today 
I say what I mean but I don't mean what I say 
Well, well, it's fine out 

Well, well, what do I say 
I've never seen a bad day look quite this way 
And well, well, what do I do 
When all of my thoughts run right back to you 
Looks like I meant to speak with logic, 
but hon', the carnal always gets in the way 
Well well, this fire was more funner than proper grammar anyway 

[Chorus]

Then you get to the part where your heart just wants to die 
Then you get to the part where your heart screams it just sighs 
Then you get to the part where your heart knows it's a crime 
So it flies like a bird, it's heard, it's heard, it's heard the word 

[Chorus]

Today, today, today, today 
Well, well, it's fine out
