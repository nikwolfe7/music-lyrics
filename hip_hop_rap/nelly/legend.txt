He wants to be, he wants to be, with everything under the sun
He wants to be, he wants to be, with everything under the sun

[Chorus:]
And like a legend that rises and then falls I cannot be his only one

He makes me feel, he makes me feel, like you used to, 
whoa like you used to
He makes me feel, he makes me feel, like you used to, 
whoa like you used to

[Chorus:]
And like a fickle flower when it first sees the light 
I cannot show just how I fight
And like a fickle flower when it first sees the light 
I cannot show just how I fight

Babe I saw you walking, it was after midnight
Carrying nothing except for a flashlight
You wanted to be Romeo so low at my window
You wanted to be Romeo so low at my window
Will you open the door for me if you believe in chivalry
Will you open the door for me if you believe in chivalry
For I do not think you low though you bow to me so-so
I do not think you low though you bow to me so-so

[Bridge:]
I know you want to drink from the purest wine
But the drink is far more sour then you would ever think
He wants to be, he wants to be with everything under the sun
And she wants to burn, she wants to burn hot like that sun, 
whoa hot like that sun

[Chorus]
Just like a legend that rises and then falls I cannot be his only one
And like a callous, cold, callous woman she'll never know what she did done

So like this legend that rises and then falls I'll never be his only one
