
I've said sorry over a thousand times 
Is there anything to say to you to help you dry your eyes? 
I would make it all better if I could, I'll help you realise 
I cry when you cry, I hurt when you hurt 
I make mistakes but I can't turn back time 

I'm only human 
Forgive me 
I'm only human 
Love me 
I'm only human 
Save me, save me from myself 
I'm no super woman 
Embrace me 
I'm fragile and broken 
You're just like me oh 

I'm perfectly human 
I might just tell a lie
I'm perfectly human 
But I'm an angel in disguise 

I'm staring in the mirror and a stranger's looking back 
What are you afraid of, girl? The future or the past? 
If you wanna see inside of me all you have to do is ask 
I cry when you cry, I hurt when you hurt 
I've made mistakes but I can't turn back time 

I'm only human 
Forgive me 
I'm only human 
Love me 
I'm only human 
Save me, save me from myself 
I'm no super woman 
Embrace me 
I'm fragile and broken 
Just like you, oh 

I'm perfectly human 
I might just tell a lie
I'm perfectly human 
But I'm an angel in disguise 

Maybe what tears us apart is what brings us back together 
And everything that makes us different really brings us closer 
Could you hold me for a little while? 
Could you love me without a doubt? 
I need you, I need you 

I'm only human 
Forgive me 
I'm only human 
Love me 
I'm only human 
Save me, save me from myself 
I'm no super woman 
Embrace me 
I'm fragile and broken 
You're just like me oh 

I'm perfectly human 
I might just tell a lie 
I'm perfectly human 
But I'm an angel in disguise 

We're only human perfectly human, oh 
I might just tell a lie
I'm perfectly human oh, oh 
But I'm an angel in disguise 

I'm perfectly human perfectly human 
I might just tell a lie
Perfectly human 
We're all angels in disguise
