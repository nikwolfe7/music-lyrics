How could you lie to me 
After all we've been through 
It's just so sad to see me in love with you 
I gave you all of me 
But still it wasn't enough for you 
Is this how love's supposed to be 
Now I'm tryin' to get over you 

You ain't missin' me at all 
You won't pick up the phone and call 
You don't love me 
Like you used to 
Tell me what is going on 
You get me standin' here alone 
You don't know me 
Like you used to 

Remember what you said 
When you stepped up on the scene 
You get into my head 
Had me stressin' like a feen 
No I just can't forget 
How you put that thing on me 
I wish we'd never me 
This way I won't be lonely 

You ain't missin' me at all 
You won't pick up the phone and call 
You don't love me 
Like you used to 
Tell me what is going on 
You get me standin' here alone 
You don't know me 
Like you used to 

You don't know me 
Know me like you used to 
You don't know me 

You ain't missin' me at all 
You won't pick up the phone and call 
You don't love me 
Like you used to 
Tell me what is going on 
You get me standin' here alone 
You don't know me 
Like you used to
