Oh, Its, been such a long long time
Looks like I got you off of my mind
But I can't, just the thought of you
Turns my whole world misty blue

Oh honey, just the mention of your name 
Turns a flicker to a flame
Listen to me good baby
I think of the things we used to do 
And my whole world turns misty blue

Ohhhh, baby I should forget you
Heaven knows I've tried 
Baby, when I said that I'm glad we're through
Deep in my heart I know I've lied, I've lied, I've lied

Oh, Its, been such a long long time
Looks like I got you off of my mind
But I can't, just the thought of you
Turns my whole world misty blue

Ohhhhhhh, no I can't no I can't
I can't forget you 
My whole world turns misty blue

Ohhhh My love
My whole world turns misty blue

Baby [5x] I should forget you
My whole world turns misty blue

Ohhhh My love
My whole world turns misty blue

Baby, baby I should forget you
Misty blue
