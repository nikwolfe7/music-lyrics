What goes around comes around, you better realize 
You kill life. You kill life. Why? Why? 
I see your eyes, I see your lies. 
I see you hide, inside. 
What goes around comes around, now it's your time. 
How long can you lie? 
How long can you hide? 
How long can you live with your soul bleed? 
How long can you live with your soul..... 

Chorus Bleed! Bleed! Bleed! Bleed! Bleed! Bleed! [repeats] 

What goes around comes around, no more lies. 
You kill life. You kill life. Why? Why? 
I see a mother cry. I see a brother cry. 

Bring it on! Bring it!!! 

I'll make you bleed and you're bleeding now bleed! [repeats] 
Motherfucker! 

I got my pride and that's all I need! 
I'll make you bleed with another blow without the radio. 
Don't take advantage of this process. 
You might have to digest a blade, made for your ass to fade. 
I'm livin' on instinct. 
Never think when I'm rushin', bones crushin'. 
When I put your sorry ass in a package, you piece of shit! 
Sealed and delivered from a savage, and now you sweat because you're going down. 
You envious clown! Bleed! 

Chorus
