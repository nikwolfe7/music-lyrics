Ye yo ye yo ye yo ye yo

Sometimes...
I don't love you anymore
I'm in love with you
I think that I'm going mad
I do
well

Meanwhile...
You been runnin' through my dome
Won't leave me alone
Ooh chile...
Why it got to be this way 
gone on!

Can you tell me where, oh where
Oh where, oh where
WHERE DID THE LOVE GO

Sometimes...
I think that you're draining me
I want you at home
I feel like forgiving you
I don't

Meanwhile...
I cannot blame you, my love
I'm sitting here alone
Ooh chile...
This love affair ain't what it was 
gone on
Can you tell me where, oh where
Oh where, where
WHERE DID THE LOVE GO

Ye yo ye yo ye yo ye yo ye yo
