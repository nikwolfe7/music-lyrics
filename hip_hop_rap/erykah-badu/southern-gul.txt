I'm from the South  
I'm a Southern Girl  
Home of the burning church  
Don't know much about the world  
Home of the pocket stones  
Home of the booty songs  
Home of the fingerwave that lasts  
All night long  
Home of the On   On  
Home of the dominoes  
Home of the two piece and a pepper  
Home of the teeth is gold  
Home of the Never Miss  
Home of the platinum hits  
I'm a Southern Girl

Countryfied 
Everything I eat is fried  
Got a Southern drawl  
I'm so country, y'all  
Well that's way down South  
Yeah it's way down low  
Check my Southern-fried style  
And my Southern flow  
 Southern Girl>  

Countryfied 
I like my Tofu fried  
Got about a hundred friends  
That ain't caught on the trends  
Don't know about the Internet  
Don't know about the radio  
Don't know about the television  
All I know is 'bout my flow  
My kin folks snet me out  
To make money for the house  
Hooked up with my boy, Rahzel  
I sure hope the record sell

From way down South  
Got a dirty way  
'Cause I got a dirty mouth, dirty South
