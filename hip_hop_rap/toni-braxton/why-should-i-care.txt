Back in the day
When I was younger
I wasn't afraid
Of giving my heart to you
Now and again
I get sentimental
But I know it's just a phase
I'm going throuth
And every time I start to slip
I just remind myself
I need only think of it
I went throuth so much hell
You say ya wanna get things back
The way they used to be
Can you give me one good reason
Why should I darlin'

Why should i care
Why should I care for you
Why should i care
Why should I care for you
Why should I care
Why should i care
Why should I care for you
Why should I care
Why should I care

Back in the day
I shoulda been wiser
But what can I say
I shoulda been onto you
But I was afraid
That you'd break my hert in two
Fate would it that you broke it anyway baby
And every time I close my eyes
I just remind myself
You told about a million lies
You put my heart throuth hell
And now you wanna get with me
Just for old times sake
Well I am not about to make that same mistake

Why should I care
Why should I care for you
Why should I care
Why should I care for you
Why should I care
Why should I care for you
Why should I care
Why should I care

You see a girlthat you gave all your love
I see a girln you took advantage of
You see a girl that you cannot forget
I see a man that I cannot forgive
Tell me why

Why should I care
Why should I care for you
Why should I care
Why should I care for you
Why should I care
Why should I care for you
Why should I care
Why should I care

Back in the day when I was young
I wasn't afraid to love
Back in the day
You where the one what was I thinking of
Back in the day
Shoulda been wiser
Shoulda been onto you
But I was afraid i make a mistake
No one knows
