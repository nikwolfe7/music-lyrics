Is there a place I can go
Is there a light to get me there
If I've forgotten what to say
It's because all words are dust
If this is really what you think
How come you won't look me in the eye
All this crying in your sleep
As I lie awake beside

Is there a T-shirt I can wear
Coz I am soaking look at me
What do you mean I don't love you
I am standing here, aren't I
Maybe you thought of it first
Maybe I get all the praise
Is there a place I can go
Is there a light to get me there
