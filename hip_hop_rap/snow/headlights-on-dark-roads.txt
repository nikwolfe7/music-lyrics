For once I want to be the car crash 
Not always just the traffic jam 
Hit me hard enough to wake me 
And lead me wild to your dark roads 

Headlights... before me 
So beautiful, so clear 
Reach out... and take it 
Cos I'm so tired of all ths fear 

My tongue is lost, oh, I can't tell you 
Please just see it in my eyes 
I pull up thorns from our ripped bodies 
And let the blood fall in my mouth 

Headlights... before me 
So beautiful, so clear 
Reach out... and take it 
Cos I'm so tired of all ths fear 

Headlights... before me 
So beautiful, so clear 
Reach out... and take it 
Cos I'm so tired of all ths fear
