You're not fair
Telling me
You faked every orgasm
You've had with me
That's just fine
Now it's over
And I'm out here
Banging my head
After all the dancing
And spilling beer all over the place
I lie out here
In disgrace
You've had your fun
Kissed some bloke you shouldn't have
Right in front of me
Punched him to the floor
I could have killed him there
But I got thrown out
I'll get him some other time
When he leasts expects it
