I want something 
That's purer than the water 
Like we were 

It's not there now 
Ineloquence and anger 
Are all we have 

Like Saturn's rings 
An icy loop around me 
Too hard to hold 

Lash out first 
At all the things we don't like 
Or understand 

And it's beginning to get to me 
That I know more of the stars and sea 
Than I do of what's in your head 
Barely touching in our cold bed 

Are you beginning to get get my point 
They're always fighting with aching joints 
It's doing nothing but tire us out 
No one knows what this fight's about 

The answer phone 
The lonely sound of your voice 
Frozen in time 

I only need 
The compass that you gave me 
To guide me on 

And it's beginning to get to me 
That I know more of the stars and sea 
Than I do of what's in your head 
Barely touching in our cold bed 

Are you beginning to get get my point 
They're always fighting with aching joints 
It's doing nothing but tire us out 
No one knows what this fight's about 

It's so thrilling but also wrong 
Don't have to prove that you are so strong 
Cos I can carry you on my back 
After our enemies attack 

I tried to tell you before I left 
But I was screaming under my breath 
You are the only thing that makes sense 
Just ignore all this present tense 

We need to feel breathless with love 
And not collapse under its weight 
I'm gasping for the air to fill 
My lungs with everything I've lost 

We need to feel breathless with love 
And not collapse under its weight 
I'm gasping for the air to fill 
My lungs with everything I've lost
