The earth is warm next to my ear 
Insects noise is all that I hear 
A magic trick makes the world disappear 
The skies are dark, they're dark but they're clear 

A distant motorcade and suddenly there's joy 
The snow and tickertape blurs all my senses numb 
It's like the finish line where everything just ends 
The crack of radios seems close enough to touch 

Cold water, cleaning my wounds 
A side parade, with a single balloon 
I'm done with this, I'm counting to ten 
Blue as seas, running to them 

I feel like I am watching everything from space 
And in a minute I hear my name and I wake 
I think the finish line's a good place we could start 
Take a deep breath, take in all that you could want
