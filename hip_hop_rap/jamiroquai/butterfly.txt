Little butterfly come back to me
Everything that I want written on your face
I want it, I want it [x2]

So take me where you want to
It's your love that I chase
I want it, I want it [x2]

Now you got something
I want it, I want it
So beautiful
I want it, I want it
And the way you move me baby
Its like no other girl
I want it, I want it [x2]

Butterfly that came and butterfly in June
So colour in my wings
And let me hold your hand
I could be the sun and you could be my moon
But all you ever say is catch me if you can
Feel like a butterfly
Searching in the summer sky
A perfect love so hard to find

Little butterfly come back to me [x4]

Honey you pushing a condition
But I don't mind
I want it, I want it [x2]

I think you're my addiction
But that's alright
I want it, I want it
That's alright
I want it, I want it
You've got to slow down
I can't keep up with you
I want it, I want it
No no no All the other butterflies
They don't love like we do
I want it, I want it [x2]

I feel like I'm a butterfly in June
So colour in my wings and let me hold your hand
I could be the sun and you could be my moon
But all you ever say is catch me if you can
Feels like a butterfly
Searching in the summer sky
A perfect love so hard to find
Little butterfly come back to me [x4]
