Nowhere to go
But I'll still be cruising
I live this life long
Long long time

You know I'm drifting along drifting along
Can't see where I'm going
I will get to my destination

I' m feeling the pressure pressure
All around me crumble man now
But I won't be put down this time

I'm shifting along
Though I sing a sweet song sweet song
We'll murder in the streets where I be livin'

I'm closing my eyes closing my eyes
Don't want to see killin'
Gentle giants will roam forever

I'm cruising the street
Wondering who I will meet
Oh love has got to reign in our world

La la la la
La la la la la
I don't know where I am going to
I don't know where I am going to

La la la la
La la la la la
I don't know where I am going to
Drifting along

Drifting along
Closing up my ears to the sound
I don't want to hear, crying
