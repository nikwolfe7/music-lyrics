My head's under pressure baby
Life's the same
It's a suicidal incubator that's killing my brain
There must be some sonic infiltrator making the strain
See I'm a high-pressure operator
In case the same

Stop don't panic, it's just a thing I do
Its not so tragic, nothing to hold on to
I'm like a tiger in a cage so I'm afraid
How do I stop this crazy rage
I'm not so cool about my own route
I'm gonna hit my switch and fly through

Stop, don't panic, it's just a thing I do
Its not, so tragic, nothing to hang on to
Stop don't panic, it's just a thing I do
It's not so tragic, nothing to hang on to
Something I hang on to

It's just a thing I do
Nothing to hang on to
Stop, It's just a thing I do
Nothing to hang on to
It's just a thing I do
Nothing to hang on to
