[Cassandra] 
I'm your girl, you're my man 
And we stand hand and hand 
When we're together 
You know it 
But when we are apart 
It just breaks my poor heart 
I need you forever 
By my side 

Bridge 

Charisse 
Baby I want you 
And you want me 
Can't stand the fact 
That we can't be 
Together constantly 
I wanna be in your arms 
Makin' love allnight long 
Ooh baby, ooh yeah 
You got me thinkin' of you 

Chorus 

Thinkin' about you on those lonely nights 
The sun doesn't shine on those sunny days 
Without you right here, baby by my side 
The stars don't twinkle and shine bright at night 

[Cassandra] 
There's no doubt, in my mind 
If we both had the time 
We'd spend it together 
You know it 
You and me, me and you 
You know just what we'd do 
Allnight 
Over and over again 

Bridge Charisse 

Baby I want you 
And you want me 
Can't stand the fact 
That we can't be 
Together constantly 
I wanna be in your arms 
Makin' love allnight long 
Ooh baby, ooh yeah 
You got me thinkin' of you 

Chorus 

Thinkin' about you on those lonely nights 
The sun doesn't shine on those sunny days 
Without you right here, baby by my side 
The stars don't twinkle and shine bright at night 

You got me thinkin' about you 
Mmmmm 
Ah yeah 
Ery second 
Oh 
Uh 
Uh huh 

You got me thinkin' about you 

Chorus 

Thinkin' about you on those lonely nights 
The sun doesn't shine on those sunny days 
Without you right here, baby by my side 
The stars don't twinkle and shine bright at night 

Thinkin' about you on those lonely nights 
The sun doesn't shine on those sunny days 
Without you right here, baby by my side 
The stars don't twinkle and shine bright at night
