Sittin' here lonely 
Wonderin' if you're home 
Thinkin' about callin' you 
Cuz I don't wanna be alone 
The fireplace is burnin' 
But baby yet I'm still cold mm-hmm 
Without your body next to me 
Somehow I just don't feel whole, no 

I'll leave the door unlocked for you 
Just come right on in 
And make yourself comfortable 
I'll treat you like a friend 

We can talk about some things 
And baby we can do some things 
The perfect night for company 
I need you to visit me 

Let's disappoint some friends 
And let 'em know we're stayin' in 
Makin' love until no end 
I need you to visit me 

Now you don't have to phone me first 
Cuz baby I'll be right here right here babe 
I've got the whole night planned for us 
Now all I need is your body near 
Boy you know what bell to ring 
Don't you make me wait too long 
Now you should get over baby 
Make yourself right at home 

We can talk about some things 
And baby we can do some things 
The perfect night for company 
I need you to visit me 

Let's disappoint some friends 
And let 'em know we're stayin' in 
Makin' love until no end 
I need you to visit me 

Now once you get over 
Once you get over here my darling 
You will never wanna leave, no 
You won't ever want to leave my darling 
See forever is a plan that I have for you 
Are you ready are you ready 
To come over to come over 
Cuz I'm waiting for your loving 
We can talk about kissing and huggin' 
And touchin', feelin' 
Are you willing? 

Ohh, come on over to my place 
And let me love your body down love you down 
Said we both could use some good lovin' tonight, yeah 
So much to talk about 
Here I am, a lonely woman 
And there you are, a lonely man mmm 
See we got so much in common 
That baby you should be my man mm-hmm 

See my body is calling you 
And your body is calling me 
So come on over baby 
And let's talk about something 

We can talk about some things 
And baby we can do some things 
The perfect night for company 
I need you to visit me 

Let's disappoint some friends 
And let 'em know we're stayin' in 
Makin' love until no end 
I need you to visit me
