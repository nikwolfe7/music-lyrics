[Charisse] 
As I look back in time 
Baby I apologize 
Must have been blind 
Now I need you by my side 
As I look back in time 
Baby I apologize 
Must have been blind 
Now I need you by my side 

Chorus 

As I look back in time 
Baby I apologize 
Must have been blind 
Now I need you by my side 
As I look back in time 
Baby I apologize 
Must have been blind 
Now I need you by my side 

[Cassandra] 
Remember the sin 
When I was young and so much fun 
Playin' the games that we would play 
I hurt you in a bad way 
Never did I imagine that 
I would yearn for your lovin' back 
Back in my heart again 
Back in my heart again 
When I look back now 

Chorus 

As I look back in time 
Baby I apologize 
Must have been blind 
Now I need you by my side 
As I look back in time 
Baby I apologize 
Must have been blind 
Now I need you by my side 

[Cassandra] 
In the begining 
I was just so in love with you 
Momma said wait you're way too young 
You got your whole life ahead of you 
Never did I imagine that 
I would yearn for your lovin' back 
Back in my heart again 
Back in my heart again 
When I look back now 

Chorus 

As I look back in time 
Baby I apologize 
Must have been blind 
Now I need you by my side 
As I look back in time 
Baby I apologize 
Must have been blind 
Now I need you by my side 

[Charisse] 
I'm lookin' for someone I can love 
Lookin' for some I can trust 
And I know that you're the one 
I am not to afraid to let you know I'm wrong 

You're the one my heart beats for 
No need to look no more 

[Charisse] 
Want you to know that 
I want you, need you, oh 

Let me know 
Let me know boy 
Tell me if you're out there 
Cause I need you right here 
Let me know 
Let me know boy 
Tell me if you're out there 
Cause I need you right here 

Let me know 
Let me know boy 
Tell me if you're out there 
Cause I need you right here 
Let me know 
Let me know boy 
Tell me if you're out there 
Cause I need you right here
