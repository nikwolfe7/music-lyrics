[Intro] 
Yo, I'ma tell you 'bout them four letter words 
Your momma used to tell you about, uh-huh 
I'm not talkin' 'bout cusswords 
I'm talkin' 'bout this word, often said 
But do we mean it? 
Heh, I'ma tell you 'bout L-O-V-E, know what I'm sayin' 
You get around your crew, I'm just "aiight" 
Heh, but you ain't say that last night 
For real, you know, it's all gravy baby 
Uh, yeah, it's all gravy baby 
But uh, I'ma break it down to you like this 
Uh, uh, hit me 

Tryin' to get nobody comin' at me 
Cuz you with your good buddy 
It seems to me it's all of a sudden 
Cuz the night before 
You treated me so different, see 

Tryna say it wasn't too funny 
Sayin' that you playin' like you really love me 
Sweet nothings, so you can 
Cut somethin', touch somethin' 
Last night you really thought you 
Were tryna do something 

Don't you want me? 
Don't you need me? 
To give you kisses 
And to hold you tight 
Don't you love me? 
Don't you trust me? 
Cuz I remember 
That's what you said last night 

So what you wanna do baby? 
Are you still showin' out? Are you actin' shady? 
You can keep that boy, it's gravy baby 
But I refuse to let you come around my way 
And continue to play me baby 
Cuz I believed when you said to me 
I was all you need 
Or was you fakin' me? 

Don't you want me? 
Don't you need me? 
To give you kisses 
And to hold you tight 
Don't you love me? 
Don't you trust me? 
Cuz I remember 
That's what you said last night 

I really wanna be your lover 
I want you to love me like no other 
If you feel you in a tired situation 
Won't be the one that you're playin' 
I know you feel the same way too 
But you front in front of your crew 
It's aiight, I can play that too 
As long as you remember 
What you say you'll do 

Don't you want me? 

Don't you want me? 
Don't you need me? 
To give you kisses 
And to hold you tight 
Don't you love me? 
Don't you trust me? 
Cuz I remember 
That's what you said last night 

Don't you want me? 
Don't you need me? 
To give you kisses 
And to hold you tight 
Don't you love me? 
Don't you trust me? 
Cuz I remember 
That's what you said last night
