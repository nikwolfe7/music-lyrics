I can't be that other woman 
No, no, no, no, no, no 
I can't be that other woman 
No, no, no, no, no, no 

You only see me every Friday night at nine 
Can't imagine what you told her this time 
You never take me to a public place 
Worried that somebody might notice your face 
Rush to the liquor store and then a motel 
Call up your friends to just cover your trail 
Not a word until the week goes by 
You call me when you want some pie 

1 -	Why am I crying every night over you? 
	You're never gonna leave her 
	Finally I woke up and smelled the coffee 
	I understand 
	Why two women can't share one man 

2 -	I can't be that other woman 
	I can't love you down 
	Can't keep creeping around 
	Can't be that other woman 
	Yes I want you bad 
	But she needs you much more 

Repeat 2 

You never see me on the holidays 
You disappear and won't return my page 
You take my body in the middle of night 
I ain't gon' lie cause boy you do it so right 
And then you melt me with them same three words 
Sweetest seduction that I've ever heard 
And in the morning with the sun rise 
You run to her, I realize 

Repeat 1 

Repeat 2 
Repeat 2 

Can I get a witness? 
Yes you can 
Oh can I get a witness? 
Oh yeah,  oh yeah, yeah, yeah 
Can I get a witness? 
You know you can 
Have you ever been in love with another girl's man? 

Can I get a witness? 
Yes you can 
Can I get a witness? 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah 
You said you're leaving a thousand times 
But I won't believe till the papers are signed 

I can't be that other woman 
I won't believe it, no 
Gotta be the only one 
I can't be that other woman 
She needs you much more 

I can't be that other woman 
Can't, no 
No more late night booty calls 
I can't be that other woman 
She needs you much more 

Repeat 2 

In the morning, with the sun rise 
You will run to her...
