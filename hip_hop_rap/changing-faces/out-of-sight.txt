Malik 
Hey what's up 
Leave your name and your number 
And I'll call you back 
God bless 

Changing Faces 
it's been so long 
Since I've held you 
Yet thoughts of you come to me 
And your face appears while lying here 
it's like never being here without you 
And even when you're far away 
I appreciate you every day 

I may be in Japan 
London or France 
No matter where I am 
you're still my man 
Winter spring summer fall 
Whenever you should call 
No matter where I am 
you're still my man 
Leave a message 

Malik 
Even I write undertone love songs 
The verses are addressed to you 
My lady my baby 
it's like always writing songs in love with you 
These insides of mine don't lie 
you're always on my mind 

I can be on city streets 
Or down south in the country 
Any where in the world 
you're still my girl 
Eight days in a week 
Whenever you need me 
Any where in the world 
you're still my girl 

Changing Faces 
Sometimes I find it hard to bear 
The pressures of this world 
Until I speak or think or dream of you 

Malik 
Sometimes it's strange to find 
All that matter is you at times 
It feels so good to know 
That you're all mine you're mine 

Changing Faces 
Ooh I may be in Japan 
London or France 
No matter where I am 
you're still my man 

Malik 
I can be on city streets 
Or down south in the country 
Any where in the world 
you're still my girl 

Changing Faces 
Winter spring summer fall 
Whenever you should call 
Anywhere in the world baby 
I'm still your girl 

Malik 
Eight days in a week 
Whenever you need me 
No matter where I am 
I'm you're man 

Malik and Changing Faces 
Oh oh oh oh
