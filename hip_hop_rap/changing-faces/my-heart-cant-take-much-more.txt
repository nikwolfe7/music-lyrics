Don't leave 
This way 
Oh baby 
Ooooh oooh ooh 

Please stay 
Find a way 

Oh, ooh 

[Charisse] 
Did I ever hurt you, intentionally 
Did I ever mean to make this love stay 
Didn't know how fragile love could be 
Or just how easy it brakes, oh no 

[Cassandra] 
Don't be so cruel, baby we can work it out 
Like all the other times before 
Why don't you turn around, don't throw it all away 
Believe me we got something worth fighting for, yeah 

Chorus 

Baby don't leave 
Leave me this way 
I've been hurt once before 
And my heart can't take much more 
Baby please stay 
Let's find a way 
Don't you walk out that door 
Cause my heart can't take much more 

Mmmmm, listen 

[Charisse] 
This is just crazy though the changes we go through 
And all this confussion with no communication 
I want you baby and nobody else, no 
Cause my heart is greevin' over you, hey 

[Cassandra] 
How can I break through this wall of silence 
Your taleless eyes are telling me a way through, oh 
I'll do anything that you want me to 
Just talk to me, tell me what I need to do 
But baby don't leave 

Chorus 

Baby don't leave 
Leave me this way 
I've been hurt once before 
And my heart can't take much more 
Baby please stay 
Let's find a way 
Don't you walk out that door 
Cause my heart can't take much more 

[Cassandra] 
I've got no pride 
I got nowhere else to hide 
Cause you made up your own mind 
I never dreamed that things could get this bad now 
Look me in the eyes 
And tell me that you don't love me 
Cause I know, baby I ain't got no business 
Leavin' in this world without you 
In it, no way 
I'm down on my knees beggin' you please 
Stayyyyyyyyy 

Chorus 

Baby don't leave 
Leave me this way 
I've been hurt once before 
And my heart can't take much more 
Baby please stay 
Let's find a way 
Don't you walk out that door 
Cause my heart can't take much more 

[Charisse] 
I just can't take it no more, ohhhhhhhhhhhhh 

[Cassandra] 
Baby don't go 
This way, oh no baby 
I can't take much more can't take much more 
Baby please stay baby please stay 
Gonna find a way 

Oh uh uh no no no 
Oh uh uh no no no 
Oh uh uh no no no 
Oh uh uh no no no
