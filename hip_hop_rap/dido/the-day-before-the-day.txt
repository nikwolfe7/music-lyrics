Speeches won't be made today, clocks will carry on 
Flowers won't be left in parks, work will still be done 
People won't be dressed in clack, babies will be born 
No flags will fly, the sun will rise, 
But we know that you are gone 

You who love to love and believed we can never give enough 

It wakes me every single night, thinking through the day 
Did you stop at any time have doubts at any stage 
Were you calm or were you numb or happy just to get it done 
I've lived my life without regret until today 

You who love to love and believed we can never give enough 

I didn't get to say goodbye the day before the day 
Was trying to get to work on time, that's why I turned away 
And missed the most important thing you've ever tried to say 
I've lived my life without regret until today 

You who love to love and believed we can never give enough 
And you who hoped that underneath we all felt the same 
That was until the day before the day
