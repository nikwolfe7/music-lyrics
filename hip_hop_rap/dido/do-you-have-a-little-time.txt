If you're feeling low and lost today
You're probably doing too much again
You spend all your hours just rushing around
Do you have a little time
Do you have a little time for me?
Slow down my love you're confusing me
If you're feeling stressed just try calling
You spend your time waiting for anyone to see
Do you have a little time

Do you have a little time for me?
If you should stop for a while
You will find me standing by
Over here at the side of your life
I'd like to hold you still, remind you of all you've missed
If you have a little time
If you have a little time that is

Why do you still run when you could walk with me
Life will pass you by when you move as quickly
What can you see when you're spinning around
Do you have a little time
Do you have a little time for me
If you should stop for a while
You will find me standing by
Over here at the side of your life
I like to hold you still, remind you of all you've missed
If you have a little time
If you have a little time that is

If you let me listen I'll make you feel clear
You spend your time waiting for anyone to see
If you should stop for a while
You will find me standing by
Over here at the side of your life
I'd like to hold you still, remind you of all you've missed
If you have a little time
If you have a little time that is
If you should stop for a while
You will find me standing by
Over here at the side of your life
I'd like to hold you still, remind you of all you've missed
If you have a little time
If you have a little time that is
