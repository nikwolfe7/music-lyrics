I found no peace 
In the lies that I've told, 
I'm only hurt by the blows that get withheld 
The sharper I get cut 
The harder I get held 
More that I believe 
That you will come to me 

Without you I've been burnin' love 
Whao-ao 
You're the one that I've been calling for 
Whao-ao 
Without you I've been burnin' love 
Whao-ao 
You're the one that I've been calling for 

I found no peace 
In the lies that I've told, 
I'm only hurt by the blows that get withheld 
The sharper I get cut 
The harder I get held 
More that I believe 
That you will come to me 

Without you I've been burnin' love 
Whao-ao 
You're the one that I've been calling for 
Whao-ao 
Without you I've been burnin' love 
Whao-ao 
You're the one that I've been calling for 

'Bout you I've been burnin' love 
Whao-ao 
You're the one that I've been calling for 

Without you I've been burnin' love 
Whao-ao 
You're the one that I've been calling for 
Whao-ao 
Without you I've been burnin' love 
Whao-ao 
You're the one that I've been calling for
