Ask me where I go tonight I go back to today last year. 
Me and you had to make each other happier, now theres hope with everything.

Its hard enough to feel the world as it is and hold on anything. 
Without these quiet times you've brought round here.

Im Gonna have to run away, im sure that I belong some other place. 
I've seen another side of all I've seen it keeps me wondering where my family is.

Its hard enough to see the world as it is, and hold on anything. 
Without these quiet times coming round here.

Now I miss you...
Now I want you...
But I can't have you...
Even when your here...

Suppose I have to take you with me, broken mind I'd rather leave you here.
To forget everything you've seen and known erase every idea.

And you walk up in the street, and hold my hand and smile. 
Well I won't be taken in, cus I know how it turns out. 
And it takes me back to these quiet times coming round here.

Now I miss you...
Now I want you...
Your not coming back...
And I need you...
But I can't have you...
Even when your here...

Now I miss you...
Now I want you...
Your not coming back...
And I need you...
But I can't have you...
Even when your here...
