I know what you came for  
And I know when you'll leave  
You came for my heart  
And it's lost to me  
For I won't stop you  
I will open my door  
My heart is here waiting  
I don't need it no more  
I know why you're leaving  
And I'll just let it be  
I am left with nothing  
And now you're lost to me  
For I can't stop you  
I will open my door  
My heart is here waiting  
I don't need it no more  

I know why you're waiting  
Give me time breathe  
Before you take my heart now  
And just get up and leave  
For I won't stop you  
I will open my door  
My heart is here waiting  
I don't need it no more  

For love makes a fool of me  
For love makes a part of us  
You know it's worthless  
As worthless can be  

For love makes a fool of me  
For love makes a part of us  
You know it's worthless  
As worthless can be
