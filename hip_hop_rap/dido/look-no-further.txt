I might have been a singer 
Who sailed around the world? 
A gambler who wins millions 
And spent it all on girls 

I might have been a poet 
Who walked upon the moon? 
A scientist who would tell the world 
I discovered something new 

I might have loved a king 
Been the one to end a war 
A criminal who drink Champaign 
And never could be caught 

But among your books 
Among your clothes 
Among the noise and fuss 

I've let it go 

I can't stop and catch my breathe 
And Look No further for happiness 
And I will not turn again 
'Cause my heart has found its home 

Everyone I'll never meet 
And friends I won't now make 
The adventures that they could have been 
And the risks I'll never take 

But Among Your Books 
Among your clothes 
Among the noise and fuss 

I've let it go 

I can't stop and catch my breathe 
And Look No further for happiness 
And I will not turn again 
'Cause my heart has found its home
