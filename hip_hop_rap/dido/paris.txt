Coming back from paris on the train,
I really didnt care if the journey took all day,
Trying to turn the pages of my magazine,
Ill try to keep a hold all your hand,
And ordering a coffee that i wouldn't ever drink,
Just to keep you and paris on my mind, [x2]
I didnt know it would be the last time, 
The last time,
I saw you,
At waterloo we went our separate ways,
When i got in my cab i didnt turn and wave,
Didnt go to work just went to bed,
Trying to keep you and paris on my mind [x2]
I didnt know it would be the last time,
The last time,
I saw you,
I phoned your office this afternoon,
Hey said they hadn't heard anything from you,
Its been seven days without a word,
I have to keep you and paris on my mind, [x2]
I didnt know it would be the last time, 
The last time, 
I saw you,
Going back to paris on the train,
Raining and here without you,
Its not the same,
I have to do this journey one more time,
Just to keep you and paris on my mind [x2]
I didnt know it would be the last time,
The last time,
I saw you,
The  last time, 
I saw you,
The last time,
I saw you,
The last time, 
I saw you
