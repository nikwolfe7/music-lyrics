I'm comin' 'round to open the blinds 
You can't hide here any longer 
My God you need to rinse those puffy eyes 
You can't last here any longer 

And yes they'll ask you where you've been 
And you'll have to tell them again and again 

And you probably don't want to hear tomorrow's another day 
Well I promise you you'll see the sun again 
And you're asking me why pain's the only way to happiness 
And I promise you you'll see the sun again 

Come on take my hand 
We're going for a walk, I know you can 
You can wear anything as long as it's not black 
Please don't mourn forever 
She's not coming back 

And yes they'll ask you where you've been 
And you'll have to tell them again and again 

And you probably don't want to hear tomorrow's another day 
Well I promise you you'll see the sun again 
And you're asking me why pain's the only way to happiness 
And I promise you you'll see the sun again 
And I promise you you'll see the sun again 

Do you remember telling me you found the sweetest thing of all 
You said one day this was worth dying for 
So be thankful you knew her at all 
But it's no more 

And you probably don't want to hear tomorrow's another day 
Well I promise you you'll see the sun again 
And you're asking me why pain's the only way to happiness 
And I promise you you'll see the sun again 
And I promise you you'll see the sun again 
And I promise you you'll see the sun again 
And I promise you you'll see the sun again 
I promise you you'll see the sun again 

See the sun again 
See the sun again 
See the sun again 
See the sun again 

See the sun again 
See the sun again 
See the sun again 
See the sun again
