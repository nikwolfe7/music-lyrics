Walking home, burnt and red 
"Sticky thin" he said 
Let us go down in the woods 
"Can you be careful?" she said 
Us 2 little gods with the world at our feet 

"Sticky thin, how you've grown?" They said 
"You'll never fit in your long white dress 
When's he going to try and get a job?"
"I'm thankful for what we've got" She said 
Us 2 little gods with the world at our feet 

Just in this life, I need no other 
Just this day, I need no more 
Just this moment, let it all stop here 
Let it all stop here I've had my fill. 

"Summers here, early again 
Let's take the kid and go and celebrate 
Drinking beer, moon on the left 
And there's the sun, hold my hand" He said 
Us 3 little gods, with the world at our feet 

Just in this life, I need no other 
Just this day, I need no more 
Just this moment, let it all stop here 
Let it all stop here I've had my fill.
