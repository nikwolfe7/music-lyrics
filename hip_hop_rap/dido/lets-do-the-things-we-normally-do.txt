Let's pretend that we'll be here tomorrow 
And I'll try for you to be a little more on time 
I know you need to say you know you've let me down 
But you haven't and it's hard to talk with people all around 

Please don't say how proud you are 
Lets do the things we normally do 
I'll say see you later 
You'll sing a line or two 
From your rebel songs sung out of tune 

Don't hold my hand for longer than you need to 

Lets forget that we're here and make some plans 
We'll go for walks 
Sit on the bench we always sat 
I'll tell you every little detail of my day and so will you 
Don't try to stay awake 
I'm feeling tired too 

This is just another day 
Let's do the things we normally do 

I'll say see you later you'll sing a line or two 
From your rebel songs sung out of tune 

Don't hold my hand for longer than you need to 

Armored cars and tanks and guns came to take away our sons 
And everybody's stood behind 
The man behind the wire 
There's a fight to love 
A fight to have 
Your bed's a battlefield and back 
And all of this will just be stripped away 

Let's do the things we normally do 
I'll say see you later you'll sing a line or two 
From your rebel songs sung out of tune 
Don't hold my hand for longer than you need to 

Don't look me in the eye more than you need to 

Don't try to say goodbye if I don't want to 
Don't say how proud you are 
And say I'm far away 
and take along your 
and say a word 
and I can say fade away
