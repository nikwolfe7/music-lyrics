No more trips to Grafton Street, 
No more going' there, 
To see you lying still, 
While we all come and go. 

No more watching sunsets, 
It seems like summer's holding on. 
And no more standing quietly at your window. 

No more driving down your road, 
Wondering when you'll be home. 
And no more peace when they all leave 
And leave us two alone. 

And time we always lose is finally found here with you. 
My love, I know we're losing but I will stand here by you. 

No more calling friends from the car saying "I don't know when, 
I'll be there but I'll do my best to come." 
No more letting you warm my hands, 
No more trying to take it in. 
And no more saying "goodbye for the last time again" 
And no more saying "goodbye for the last time again" 

And time we always lose is finally found here with you. 
My love, I know you're leaving but I will stand here by you. 

No more trips to Grafton Street, 
No more going' there, 
No more sitting up all night, 
Waiting for any word. 

Nothing's left that's safe here now, 
Nothing will bring you home 
Nothing can bring us the peace 
We had in Grafton Street.
