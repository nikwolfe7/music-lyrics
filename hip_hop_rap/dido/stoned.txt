When you're stoned, baby, I am drunk
And we make love, it seems a little desolate
It's hard sometimes not to look away
And think what's the point when I'm having to hold this fire down
I think I'll explode if I can't feel this freely now

[Chorus:]
If you won't let me fall for you
Then you won't see the best that I would love to do for you
Instead you will be missing me when I go
Cos' I'm bored of hangin out in your cold

When I feel loved baby, I join the road
And the world moves with me
When I feel lost I just slip away
Silently, quietly take my things and go
And think what's the point, think where's the hope we're coming home

[Chorus]

And if you find one day, find some freedom and relief
With this freedom maybe, maybe you will find some peace
With this peace baby, I hope it brings you back to me
Bring you home, take me home

[Chorus]

Oh, take me home
Oh, take me home
When you're stoned, baby, take me home
Oh...
