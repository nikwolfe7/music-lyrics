Some days I wanna, and some days I don't
Sometimes I can feel it and suddenly it's gone... 
Some days I can tell you the truth and some days I just don't
Only a change of mood sun goes down some one says something to quick or to soon
A touch not made one made to late army's of words can not hope to contain... 

Then It Comes And It Goes. 

And I have no control. 

Some days I can think clear and some days I won't
Sometimes I can feel it and suddenly it's gone... 
Some days I am strong and some days my skins broken and thin
That's when it feels and it takes what it needs and it leaves before I get to know
Its only a step away moments that army's of words can not hope to contain... 

Then it comes and it goes. 

And I can't make it home. 

And theres nothing at home. 

And it breaks me when it goes. 

Some days I wanna, and some days I don't
Sometimes I can feel it and suddenly its gone... 
Some days I can tell you the truth and some days I just don't
Only a change of mood dream comes out some one tells something to quick or to soon
A move not made one made to late army's of words can not hope to contain... 

Then it comes and it goes. 

And I seem to hope 

And theres nothing at home. 

And it breaks me when it goes.
