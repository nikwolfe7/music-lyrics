If I had the chance for just one day with you
One day release from here and all that you go through
Well I'd get you dressed and I'd get you out
And I know you'd be fine as soon as we broke out

So please just for one day I wouldn't talk for you
You'd tell me what to say, you'd show me what to do
And please just for one day I'd see you walk again
And we'd go hand in hand so far we can't go back

I'd do anything I could do for this one more day with you
Away from all these wires and tubes they've stuck on you
And I would buy you an early beer, we'd watch the game
And we'd talk of all friends and of work and heartbreak
You'd ask me who you'd need to kill to make it ok again
But laughing about it'd make it small anyway

So please just for one day I wouldn't guess for you
You'd tell me what you felt and what you want to do
And please just for one day I wouldn't hide from you
You wouldn't see me try keep all of you from you

So please just for one day I wouldn't talk for you
You'd tell me what to say, you'd show me what to do
And please just for one day I'd see you walk again
And we'd go hand in hand so far we can't go back

I won't cry for you, cos I will wait until
I have this day with you
