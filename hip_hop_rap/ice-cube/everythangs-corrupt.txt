[Intro: x2]
Everythang's corrupt
Everythang's fucked up
Everythang's 'bout to buck me shit out of luck

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Go to school
The teacher want to fuck the students
Go to church
My preacher turn to prostitution
The prosecution never read my files
That evil ass judge fell asleep at my trial
This shit is wild
Chickens getting sick as the cows
Birds falling out the sky, fish dying in piles
It's fishy
Politicians smell like my balls
Talking that shit will he cripple my styles
I got many
Now I'm pinching pennies, no doubt
I squeeze Lincoln so hard
A fucking booger came out
It's a shame
I used to be on top on my game
They took the shirt off my back, and replaced it with chains
I met Mr. Lee Harvey, from the "Tea Party"
He used to hate Obama 'till he felt Hurricane Charlie
Looking for his FEMA Check
It's gone with the wind
When them dicks is in
You know the fix is in

[Hook: x2]
For my birthday, buy me a politician
It's a shame that you got to dish your children
Everythang's corrupt
Everythang's fucked up
Everythang's bout' to buck me shit out of luck

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Everythang's a scam
Beat the next man, that's capitalism
They'll just, built a new prison
For your slick ass niggas
That's trying to beat the system
Put you on the front line
If you ain't re-enlist in this
It's hot, in hells kitchen
Get ready, for the lynching brainwash media
And puppet politician
Keep out of position
Out of commission
Buy, medicine or food
That's not a decision
The 99 percent
Is mad and trying to vent
Police grab my fucking arm, then they got bent
Now it's in a splint
I can't pay my rent
The interest on my credit card
I ain't made a dent
The U.S. Mint
I heard they about to print
But it's fucked up, cause I won't see a cent
I'm sick of getting ignored
This wall I can't afford
I'm going to the pent
Free room, free ward, bitch

[Hook x2]

[Outro:]
It's a wall of confusion
My niggas stay losin'
I know what ya' doin'
They drug abusin'
My bitches be choosin'
My music be uzin'
Them thugs be cruisin'
They love what you doin'
A wall of confusion
My niggas they losin'
I know what ya' doin'
The drug abusin'
My bitches be choosin'
My music be uzin'
Them thugs be cruisin'
