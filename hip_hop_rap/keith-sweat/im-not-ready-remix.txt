You know what you wanna do 
See, I'll never ever go nowhere yet 
Think of all the times 

Baby, we've been freakin' from dusk till dawn 
And I'm still not ready to go on 
That's the way it flows when it gets real good 
Back to back flexin' my manhood 

[Oh, baby] Why does it got to be so good 
[Oh, baby] Girl, you know you got me hooked 
[Oh, baby] Girl, you know you got me shook 
[Oh, baby] And I ain't goin' nowhere

I wanna go on and on and on and on 
I'm not ready to end this freaky affair 
I wanna go on and on and on and on 
Girl, I'm ready to start over again

It gets better when it keeps on flowin' 
I broke you off all night and I'm not tired 
Bring your body here and take me higher 

[Oh, baby] Why does it got to be so good

Keith Sweat/Joe Little/Willie Jones 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh 
When you walk in the door, lose the clothes 
Rest the shoes, candles are lit, I'm chillin' the Boones 
Kick back, wrap the tight pattened leather on, all black 
Showin' off the prey of the kit-kat, and it's all phat 
Steletos on, six inches, String's known as the kind s@#$ 
Lift the white flags, I got you 
Matter of fact the way I'm writin' this track 
I'mma ride you 

Baby, we've been freakin' from dusk till dawn 
And I'm still not ready to go on 
That's the way it flows when it gets real good 
Back to back flexin' my manhood 

[Oh, baby] Why does it got to be so good 
[Oh, baby] Girl, you know you got me hooked

Guarantee to please you, but first I wanted to tease you 
Before I was ready to receive you 
You say you don't wanna leave me

And I don't have a choice, baby, I believe you 
Work out, gynecological gymnastics 
Ridiculous bedroom tactics 
Love you for you, for practice 
Talk plenty s@#$ and I back it 
I get it up again and again and again and again 
Hot s@#$ flame spitter, many a b@#$% try to be Strings 
But the shoes won't fit em
