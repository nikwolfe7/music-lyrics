Oh, yeah
Ooh...ooh...

Experience is a good teacher
It takes someone like me to know
All the little games people tend to play
Some call it love
It never has a chance to grow

You deserve somethin' better, I kept tellin' myself
Just be patient, true love you'll find
I finally found someone who become my friend
And in a matter of time
Real love stepped in

The closed sign on your door
I had to tear it down
A new world of happiness
Turned me completely around

I'm in love under new management I'm in love under new management
I'm in love under new management Hey...yeah...
Someone very special came into my life Nobody, nobody
Can take his place Can take his place
He filled my empty space

There's nothin' like someone who can take care of business
You know we treat each other so well
And back together came off a little easy
It's time to celebrate
You see, I never thought I could

The closed sign on my door
I had to tear it down
A new world of happiness
Turned me completely around

So I just kept on waiting and waiting
Hoping he'd Fill up All the empty spaces in my life, oh...oh...
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Everybody tried to tell me 'bout him
But you know it's nothin' like leadin a blind horse to a pasture
You see, they could smell the grass, but they just don't know their way to it, uh-uh
But girl, just when I was about ready to throw my hands and Give up
On love, hoo...hoo...hoo...hoo...hoo...
