Ohhoohoh
Ohooh

So you don't wanna talk to me
Just don't even call me anymore

Though you don't call me anymore
I sit and wait in vain
I guess I'll rap on your door
Tap on your window pane

I wanna tell you, baby
The changes I've been goin' through
Missin' you, missin' you
Until you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do

Why did you have to decide
You had have to set me free, baby
I guess I'll swallow my pride
Beggin' you, baby, baby, baby, please see me

I'm gonna walk by myself
Just to prove my love is true, whoa, for you, baby
Until you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do

Living without you might be
Livin' in a world of constant tears
Hear my please, I've got to make you see
Our love is dying

Oh, boy, your phone you ignore, somehow I must
Somehow I must, I must explain
I guess I'll rap on your door
Tap on your window pane

And I'm gonna sit by your steps
Until I get through to you
I've got to show it to you, baby
Until you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do, babe

Until you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do, my love, my love, my love
Until you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do

I'm gonna rap on your door
Tap on your window pane, baby, baby
I'm gonna rap on your door
Tap on your, tap on your, tap on your, tap on your window

I'm gonna rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
I'm gonna rap on your door
Tap on your window pane

I'm gonna rap on your door
Rat-tat knock-knock on your window pane
I'll be there, I'll be there day and night
I'll be there night and day
Oh, I'm gonna rap on your pane
