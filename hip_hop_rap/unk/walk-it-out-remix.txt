[Chorus x2:]
Now Walk It Out [x4]
Westside Walk It Out, Southside Walk It Out, Eastside Walk It Out, Northside Walk It Out 

[Andre 3000:]
Now Walk It Out Like A Usher 
If You Say Real Talk I Probably Wont Trust Ya 
If You Wanna Go To War, The Gunz My Pleasure 
Even Jesus Had 12 Disiples On The Level,Trigger, Whatever 
Pumm You Dont Want Naw Dega 3 Thou 
I'm Like Jury Duty Your New To This Part Of Town 
Your White Tee Will To Me Looks Like A Nightgown 
Make Ya Mama Proud Take That Thing To Sizes Down 
Then You Look Like The Man That You Are Or Wat You Could Be 
I Could 
I Give A Damn 'bout Your Car But Then That Would Be 
If It Was Considered A Classic Before The Drastic Change In Production When Cars Were Metal Instead Of Plastic Value 
Is Wat I'm Talkin About 
Take Two Of These And Walk It Out 
You Be The Reason They Talk It Out 
You Cant Be The King In The Parkin Lot-- Forever 
Not Sayin I'm The Best But Till They Find Sumthin Better 
I Am Here No Fear Right Me A Letter 'till Then 
I Walk It Out [x7] I Westside Walk It O-O-Out [x3] Then Eastside Walk It O-O-Out 

[Unk:]
I Walk It Out The Bank With Alot Of Zeros 
Thats Wat My Teachers Call Me Predictions Like They Cleo 
So I Did My Dance For'm 
They Make Bout 40,000 
I Do That In A Month I'm No Resorts And Islands 
I Make Them Walk It Out Yeah Its Me Again 
But I'm With Jones That Phat Stacks And Benjamin 
I Roll With Made Men 
That Brakes The Stage In 
And Keep The Girls Happy 
So Yall Can Get The Nappy 
Gansta's They Do They Dance They Do It To My Song 
See I Was Up In Cali Crip Walkin It All Night Long 
Drop 20 On My Neck Got 10 On They Wrist 
A Billion Dolla Look A Million Dolla Kiss 
I'm Nation Wide Homie You Still At Home Homie 
With No Promotions On Me Man Thats Boloney Homie 
The Album Off In Stores Im Beatin Down Ya Block 
Now Goin Walk It Out And They Still On My Jock 

[Chorus:]
Now Walk It Out [x4]
Westside Walk It Out, Southside Walk It Out, Eastside Walk It Out, Northside Walk It Out 

[Jim Jones:]
Jones, Its Dipset Byrd Gang, Holla At Me, You Know How We Get It Up Here 

Eastside Walk It Out Bronx Walk It Out 
Queens Walk It Out You Know Brooklyn Walk It Out 
Now Harlem Walk It Out Harlem Walk It Out Harlem Walk It Out Harlem Walk **** Out 
Now We Dont Walk It Out We Drop Top Porsha It Out 
After I Floss It Out I Bring My Air Forces Out 
I'm Blowin Purple Smoke I Cough It Out
