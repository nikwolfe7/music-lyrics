All the ladies in the world
But you can do whatever you set your mind to do
Can't no one stop you
Believe that

Don't be scared, its your world, don't trip, shout it out
You're the bomb, don't be scared, its your world

I can't begin to feel the agony I know you feel
I'm tryin' to break you out of that mold that once was real
But you're grown up and now it's time to let go all your fears
It's time for you to go,
its time for you to live
You've been under your parents, 
but they can't live for you
You got to go and do 
what's best for you
Make your decisions and live by them and sweat and bleed
You must struggle to be you
Even when you're in need

Then you'll appreciate all that you have and all you own
And that no one out there can never ever take from you
Do you and all that's expected and you will break right through
This world
This crazy crazy world, this crazy world
this cold and harsh world, this cold and harsh world
this cruel and foul world
And now you're proud and all grown up and sure a woman now
Then you'll stand up 
looking ahead, feeling so proud

It's time, now's the place, do your thing, don't be scared it's your world

You're the bomb, don't be scared, its your world
It's time, now's the place, do your thing, don't be scared it's your world
