Said I work my fingers down to the bone 
I put it down from 9 to 5 so you should know 
You wanna know what else

What you think, this shit's for nothing
You're not workin'
So what more you want

Listen...

It seems that 
The harder that I work, the less you see
Ooh baby ooh baby
Who wouldn't want the life you lead
Just think about it
Living the good life, yeah 
Practically scot-free, oh oh oh oh yeah

See there it is there it is, there it is
That ungrateful shit you see what I'm talkin' 'bout
There you again, bein' worse, um yeah

And you know I'm workin' 9 to 5
Workin' hard everyday baby listen
Even put my name put my name
Even served my day served my day
Down for some overtime, yeah

See there you go there you go, there you go
Tryin' to run the show

Pay my light bill
Pay my house note

I pay the car note, light bill, house note 
What you think, this shit's for nothing
You're not workin'
So what more you want
