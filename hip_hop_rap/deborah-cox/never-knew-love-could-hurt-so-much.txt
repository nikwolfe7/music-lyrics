Heard a million stories about love 
Some were good some were bad 
I found that if you hold on too tight 
You might lose everything you have 
Didn't think my heart could easily break 
When you fall in love that's a chance you take 
Now I know from these lessons that I learned from loving you 

[Chorus:]
I know that everybody makes mistakes 
I hope you still believe it's not too late 
Cause I don't care about what people think or say 
I'd rather take a chance with you 
I'd rather be in love than be alone 
But I never knew that love could hurt so much 

I found it in my heart to forgive 
But it's hard to forget 
Cause everyday the vision creeps in 
Of you and somebody else 
All my girls told me to let you go 
But I they're wrong 
I still love you so 
I'll hold on 
'Til I gain back the trust I had in you 

[Chorus]

It's killing me but I'll get over it 
But I made my commitment to you 
Even though it's gonna leave a scar 
It could never change what's in my heart 
I'll do whatever to stay together
