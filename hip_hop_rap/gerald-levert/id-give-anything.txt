I'm waiting 
For someone who could turn my life 
around 
Someone who could make me feel 
The way I used to feel 
But she never comes 

I'm searching 
But there's no one that I'd care to talk 
about 
And all the lovers in the world 
Don't amount to much 
'Cause what I want is just one love 

And I'd give anything 
And everything 
To fall in love 
Just this one time 
I'd like to find 
What I've been dreaming of 
Well I could find someone to hold me 
But that wouldn't be enough 
But I'd give anything 
To fall in love 

Now I lay here 
I'd rather not be sleeping by myself 
staring at the wall 
I question it all 
Will she ever come 

And I'd give anything 
And everything 
To fall in love 
Just this one time 
I'd like to find 
What I've been dreaming of 
Well I could find someone to hold me 
But that wouldn't be enough... 
But I'd give anything 
To fall in love 

I'm gonna keep on making wishes 
I'm gonna keep on being strong 
I won't settle for less than true love 
I'm gonna keep in holdin' on 
I would give 

And I'd give anything 
And everything 
To fall in love 
Just this one time 
I'd like to find 
What I've been dreaming of 
Well I could find someone 
to hold me 
But that wouldn't be 
enough 
But I'd give anything 
To fall in love 

I'd give anything 
to fall in love 

In love...
