Somebody if anybody 
Someone told you 
That I've been hanging out 
Cheating at night 
Someone if anybody 
Should get that story right 
Tell them they need to go get a life 
'Cause I don't need someone 
Checking up on me 
Watching my every move in sight 
And you don't need those 
Kind of worries 
To be messin' your 
Messin' your mind 

Girl you know that I'm 
Not that kind of guy 
And you need to just ask yourself why 
Would I waste my time 
To commit such a crime 
Lose the best thing 
I have in my life 

Someone's trying to come between me 
and you 
Can't you see what they're trying to do 
They can't stand to see something so right 
See two people so satisfied 

Somebody if anybody, someone told me 
That when you go out they say you're 
So nice 
Somebody, nobody had to tell me 
That you danced and talked with lots 
Of guys 
And I don't know why they feel 
The need to let me know that you've 
Had a good time 
Maybe they thought that I would 
Get jealous get upset with you 
And start a fight 

But they don't understand that the 
Love we have is much stronger 
Than they can conceive 
There's no jealousy, there's no need 
To be, 'cause my lady only lays 
Down with me 

See I'm down with this girl, she's my 
Whole wide world and she's down 
With her man, they don't seem to 
Understand
We've got a love that's honest and true. 
No one will ever come between us two 
And everybody so confused, but it ain't 
Nobody's business what we do 

Chorus
