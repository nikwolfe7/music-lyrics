See I wanna give you everything 
I wanna love you show no shame 
I want you to know I belong to you 
See champagne and candle lights 
Breakfast in bed would be alright 
Baby there's nothing that I wouldn't do for you 

I got a lot of love to give 
And I wanna give it to you 
All I wanna know is can you handle it Baby 
Girl I swear I treat you right 
Morning, afternoon and into the night 
All I wanna know is can you handle it Baby 

I know a lot of guys call on you 
But they could never love you the way that I do 
Would you give me the chance 

When you're serious just call me 
We'll make love constantly 
Are you ready for a true romance 

Repeat 1 

If you want something real 
I swear I know you're gonna like 
The way I make you feel 
I'll give you good love and I'll never quit 
All I wanna know is can you hanlde it Baby 

Repeat 1 

Ad lib 

Repeat 1
