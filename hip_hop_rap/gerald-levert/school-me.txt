In my new life I met plenty of girls 
But none that make me wanna do 
The things you make me do 
I wanna learn what makes you feel good 

See Lord knows I tried to keep you 
Satisfied the best way that i could 
See' cause no woman has laid love down on me 
The way that you laid it on me 

Keep on laying it on me Baby 
I wanna learn all the things 
To keep you ocupied 
I wanna give you my time Baby 

1 - You be the teacher 
I won't be no fool 
I did my homework Baby 
And I'm ready for school 

2 - You can be the principal 
And I'll follow the rules 
I did my homework Baby 
And I'm ready for school 

Repeat 2 

Ad lib 

Come on and school me Baby 
Wont you teach me Baby 
Show me Baby 

I'll take notes so I can remember 
All the things that I do to make you scream 
Tell me what you like 'cause I'm willing 
and able 
I can fulfill your every dream 
See no woman has ever made 
Me wanna break down and give 
Her everything I have 
To offer and even more 

See you're the kind of girl 
That'll make a man wanna give all this money 
Give up his cars all of his dreams 
So Baby why don't you show me 

See you be the teacher 
I Won't be no fool 
I did me homeowrk Baby 
And I'm ready for school 

Repeat 2 

Repeat 1 and 2
