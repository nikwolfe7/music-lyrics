L. Stansfield/ I. Devaney 
Chorus:
Sweet memories of the love you gave me
Send me reeling into ecstasy
Sweet memories of the love you gave me
Send me crying to my room
And I don't wanna miss you
But I do
No I don't wanna miss you
But I do
The weather changes
Like life changes
Like me and you have changed
It's all about nothing to talk about
Then you're washed up in the rain
I wonder why
I let love die
Just let you slip away
I cry and cry myself to sleep at night
Mm baby baby
I'm never gonna hear the last
About how stupid I was
I'm never gonna rest until I have you
Back in my arms
Chorus
I've tried to smile
I can't 'cos I'm
Feeling sorry for myself
And I can't hide
What I feel inside
And babe it hurts like hell
I'm never gonna hear the last
About how stupid I was
I'm never gonna rest until I have you
Back in my arms
Chorus
No space or time could take me away from you
Not ever no no no not never
Ain't nothin' or no-one can split us in two
Not ever not never no no
Sweet memories of the love you gave me
Sweet memories of the love you gave me
And I don't wanna miss you
But I do
No I don't wanna miss you
But I do
