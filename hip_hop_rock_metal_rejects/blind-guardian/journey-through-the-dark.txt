Many songs I've written
About the things I saw
My inner soul's a wasteland
I can't run away from here
Try to find them
All the lost thoughts in my mind
I woke up on a hill
So many times before
Yesterday seems like a dream no more
Frozen memories laughing
They don't let me find the truth
Am I born to be a king
Or a jester of the fools

Ref.:
You're the mystical old bard
on your journey through the dark
Mystical old bard
Your journey through the dark

I can't remember my name
I never knew how to find my home
I can't remember my name
come tell me where will it end
I'm the chosen one
To perform all these things
But not for me
In illusions and reality
I'm on my journey through the dark
I'm on my journey through the dark

Ref.

Solo

I can't remember
Will I ever find myself
The distance is growing
My hope has gone away
A flash of light but nothing changes
When will it end
Which part of me remains

Soon I'll be back
On my ferryboat of tales
Where oblivion reigns
It will take all of me

Ref.
