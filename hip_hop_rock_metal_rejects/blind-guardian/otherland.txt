They rule the land
They're in command
They all the strings in hand
They are invisible
Out of sight
They've designed
A secret place
To play their games
A world, they're in control
Divine law
Divine law
Be aware
Now
Mind your steps
We are uninvited guests,
They may find and catch us
Don't forget
Do what I say
Now connect
Don't even ask
Until we're out of it
Everything's at highest stake
Come take a look
We are in
Take a breath
But don't forget
It isn't real
It isn't true
An illusion
Nothing more

You're a part of the game
You're a slave to the grind
Oblivion
Is your key to the Otherland
You're a part of the game
You're cursed
You're damned
By now you understand

You're a part of the game
You're a slave to the grind
Oblivion
You're welcome to the Otherland
You're a part of the game
You're cursed
You're damned
By now you understand

We get closer
There's no better way
Lullaby Lane
Fade is on its way

The inner district
Is the place you need to know
It's overwhelming
So let's rest here for a while

Someone else appears
Silently
Watch me when I fall down
Everything seems real
Suddenly
Perfect simulation

Come take a look
Breathe it in
Artificial wonderlands
We are wandering around
Things shall vanish
They won't last
Now I know
You understand
This world is not true
Nothing is real
Nothing at all
It's bits and pieces
We walk through

You're a part of the game...

You're a part of the game
You're a slave to the grind
Oblivion
You've reached the promised land
You're a part of the game
You're cursed
You're damned
Welcome to the Otherland

Wait
I can feel things are not right
Do not breathe
Don't look behind,
There's someone else
The observer

A trick of light
A fading line
The entrance is gone
We can't get out of it
We are slightly losing ground

Quick
It is time
We shall go
We better leave
And don't come back,
No way to run
Nowhere to hide
I fear
We're walking aimlessly

You're a part of the game...

You're a part of the game
You're a slave to the grind
Oblivion
Welcome to the Otherland
You're a part of the game
You're cursed
You're damned
You've reached
The promised land

You've crossed the line
You've reached the end
