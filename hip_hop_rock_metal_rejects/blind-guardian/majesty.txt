Now the time has come for to leave this land
Take my charge with pride sacrifice 

Oooh 

Lead: Andre 

Running and hiding I'm left for the time 
To bring back the order of devine 
Hunted by goblins no Gandalf to help 
With swords in the night 
Oh the last part of the game 
Decision of death and life 
Blood for Sauron they'll call tonight 
The final battle cry 

Lead: Andre 

Running and hiding I'm left for the time 
To bring back the order of devine 
There exist no tales and hobbits are crying 
For all 
Children of death 

Lead: Andre 

I have a dream 
The things you've to hide for 
Deliver 
Our kingdom and our reich 
Don't fall in panic 
Just give me the thing 
That I need or I kill 
Don't run away 
For what have I done 

Refrain: 
Oooh Majesty 
Your kingdom is lost 
And you will leave us behind 
Oooh Majesty 
Your kingdom is lost 
And ruins remind of your time 
Now come back 

Solo: Andre 

Refrain: 
Oooh Majesty 
Your kingdom is lost 
And you will leave us behind 
Oooh Majesty 
Your kingdom is lost 
And ruins remind of your time 
Run, run, run 

Cries 
Cries in a dark land 
Hear the voice it's cold as ice 
Eyes 
They are watching 
They look for me but cannot find 

Creature is following no place to escape 
My last steps will find the right way 
Where is the future the call of the blind 
Cause there is none to find 
Watch the sky you see no light 
My weapons burst with fear 
With the howling wolves the nazgul will die 
For all 
Children of death 

Lead: Andre 

Cries 
Cries in a dark land 
Hear the voice it's cold as ice 
Eyes 
They are watching 
They look for me but cannot find 
Run 
Run for the whole world 
It's time you cannot wait 
Lost 
Lost in a dark world 
You feel the strange but cannot see 

Too many battles we carry along from the war 
And too many frightens we feel from his law 
For so many victories we're praising so strong 
For so many blood we've lost 

Lead: Andre 

Refrain: 
Oooh Majesty 
Your kingdom is lost 
And you will leave us behind 
Oooh Majesty 
Your kingdom is lost 
And ruins remind of your time 
Run, run, run 
Behind 
Run, run
