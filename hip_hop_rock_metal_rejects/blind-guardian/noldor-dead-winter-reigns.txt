Noldor
Blood is on your hands
Your bane's
A tearful destiny

Black clouds will carry
Rain of blood
I've seen it rain

We were lost
On grinding ice
In fear and hunger
Dead winter reigned
In Araman

prebridge:
You can't escape
From my damnation
Nor run away
From isolation

bridge:
Guilty spoke the one
THis deed can't be undone
Hear my words
Fear my curse

chorus:
I know where the stars glow
And the sky's unclouded
Sweet the water runs my friend
But Noldor
Blood is on your hands
Tears unnumbered
You will shet and dwell in pain

Your homeless souls
Shall come to me
There's no release
Slain you might be
Slain you will be
Slain you will be
And the lost
Who will not reach the
House of spirits
Will grow old and weary

bridge

chorus

I've seen this bitter end
As I've foreseen
The storm and ice
And I could see it
How a million died
And I
The blame's on me
Cause I was not there

prebridge

bridge

chorus

Dead winter reigns
And tomorrow's still unknown
Lies
Condemned and betrayed
Now everything is said
See my eyes
Are full of tears
And a cruel price
We've paid
But still I can't claim
That I'm innocent

Lost
