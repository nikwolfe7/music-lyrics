I used to see in black and white
Never something in between
Waitin' on the love of my life
To come into my dreams
Everything in shades of gray
Never any blues or greens
I need someone else to turn to
Someone who could help me learn to see
All the beauty that was waiting for me
CHORUS
You&you; put the blue back in the sky
You put the rainbow in my eyes
Put silver lining in my prayers
And now there's colour everywhere
You put the red back in the rose
Just when I needed it the most
You came along to show you care
And now there's colour everywhere
My life was so predictable
Never any mystery
But ever since you shined the light
All of the is history
Now I have a hand to hold
And a reason to believe
There's someone in my life worth living for
I was hanging 'round just wishin' on a star
To put the happiness back in my heart and
CHORUS
I left those hazy days behind me
Never to return again
Now they're just a faded memory
'Cause baby it's all so clear to see
The beauty that was waiting for me
CHORUS
You care and now there's colour everywhere
There's colour everywhere
There's colour everywhere
