free time, free time 
would you tell me the secret of yr arm 
free time, free time

I cant believe this could happen to me 
caught inside someones knee 
free time, free time 
uncovered forever barest endeavor 
free time, free time 
if you want me splash me forever 
free time, free time 
let it happen the leisure, enchanting 
free time, free time

I feel combustible thats my will, say it all 
now you better cough up the dough 
if you want to join the show 
exotique is not for free 
spend wisely eternity 
engine of desire is on the road 
dont get stuck without a job

free time, free time

free time, free time 
did I mention that you control me 
free time, free time 
the merest endeavor slightly forever 
mille feuille
