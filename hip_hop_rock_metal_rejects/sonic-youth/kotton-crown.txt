[Thurston & Kim]
Love has come to stay in all the way
its gonna stay forever and every day
it feels like a wish coming true
it feels like an angel dreaming of you
feels like heaven forgiving and getting
feels like we're fading and celebrating
you got a carnal spirit spraying
I'm gonna laugh it up
You got a cotton crown I'm gonna keep it underground
you're gonna take control of the chemistry
and you're gonna manifest the mystery
you got a magic wheel in your memory
I'm wasted in time and I'm looking everywhere
I don't care where
I don't care where
angels are dreaming of you
angels are dreaming of you
angels are dreaming of you
angels are dreaming of youNew York City is forever kitty
I'm wasted in time and you're never ready
fading fading celebrating
I got your cotton crown
I got your cotton crown
I got your cotton crown
I got your cotton crown
I got your cotton crown
I got it
