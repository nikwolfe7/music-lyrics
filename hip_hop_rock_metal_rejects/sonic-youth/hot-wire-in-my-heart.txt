insulation
in my circulation
i'm a mating rhythm
sick with electricion
nazi operation
devestation

wire up a radio
and i am a mating rhythm
wire up the radio
turn the terror and find my limit

hot wire my heart
hot wire my heart
hot wire my heart

like this

[i feel now?]
they're movin' in
pull the zipper
it's sliding up
i don't have a reason
honey for your best man

wire up a radio
and i am a beating rhythm
wire up for the radio
turn the terror an'hot wire my heart
hot wire my heart
hot wire my heart

like this

a kicking in the nightshifts
greasing up/a teasing of my fingertips
i think you'll find us
anybody's title???
got my eyes on the controls
turned on let's go

wire up the radio
and i am a mating rhythm
wire up for the radio
turn the treble and fight my limit

hot wire my heart
hot wire my heart
hot wire my heart
