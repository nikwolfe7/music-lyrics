wish I could change the way that you feel
standing with him you feel more real
looking so sweet with all your might
trusted in him to put it night ?

holding his hand like a brand new kite
blue eyes sparkle, open, alright
wish I could see, the girl who'd fight
playing and laughing and trying to show it

running and falling and dying to know it
staring you down with her gaze hold it
wish I could free you but I can't don't blow itangel, gonna show it
lord
the devil, go on hold it
angel, gonna show it
lord
blow it

becuz of you, becuz of you, becuz of you, becuz of you
becuz of you, becuz of you, becuz of you, becuz of you
becuz of you, becuz of you, becuz of you, becuz of you
becuz of you, becuz of you, becuz of you, becuz of you

wish I could free you, but I can't, don't blow it
wish I could free you, but I can't, don't know it
