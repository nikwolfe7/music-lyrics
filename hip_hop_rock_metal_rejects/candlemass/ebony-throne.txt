Where's the muses cave
the isle of the dead
The sign of Eph is gone
so is the sun
Tired and confused
I sail into the night
With the devil at my shoulder
I'll be fine
I ride the straits of darkness
everyday
No light will lead my way
from my pain
Drowned in tideless pools
no haven for my mind
In grief I meet the storm
eye to eye
On the ebony throne
lies the dragonstone
My voyage to vanity
oh, take me there
To the ebony throne
I followed the sirensong
* No enlightened society
can bring me back
In the maelstrom of minds
like a will-o-the=wisp
I sail on ...
I sail the depths of apathy
alone
The world is fading
I'm a long way from home
Where's the muses cave
the island of the dead
The sign of Eph is gone
so is the sun
* No progressive technology
