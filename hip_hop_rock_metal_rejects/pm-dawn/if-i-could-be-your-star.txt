You're too far away for me to run to
A million galaxies live within you
Why can't I cry my way to your dimension
Or a new dimension not only out of sight and sound but of mind
I'm amazed by night's newest shadows
But if I could feel your moon's good intentions
Venus wants her frown and can not kiss me
So I sympathize with the dark side of the moon inside you
But...
If I could be your parallel
If I could be your one way out
If I could be your vision now
If I could be your star
If I could be a brighter light
If I could comfort you at night
If I could be your star...
If I could be your star
Must I be those rings that surround you
Can I send a satellite to your garden safely
Super nova's fight your emotions
So tell me all your reasons
Tell me why E=MC squared
You invade my space with gravitation
I don't wanna sacrifice
But I'm in orbit
How do all your miles leave you weightless
Can I touch your surface
Or will I burn up in your atmosphere
Because
If I could be your parallel
If I could be your one way out
If I could be your vision now
If I could be your star
If I could be a brighter light
If I could comfort you at night
If I could be your star...
If I could be your star
I could feel your sweet radiation
And with all the space in you I haven't seen you lately
A hundred million light years sit between us
So kill the universe
And tell me where your comets take you
Because...
If I could be your parallel
If I could be your one way out
If I could be your vision now
If I could be your star
If I could be a brighter light
If I could comfort you at night
If I could be your star...
If I could be your star
