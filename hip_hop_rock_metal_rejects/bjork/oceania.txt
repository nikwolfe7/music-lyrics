One breath away from mother Oceana  
Your nimble feet make prints in my sands  
You have done good for yourselves 
Since you left my wet embrace 
And crawled ashore 
Every boy, is a snake is a lily  
Every pearl is a lynx, is a girl 
Sweet like harmony made into flesh 
You dance by my side 
Children sublime 
You show me continents 
I see islands 
You count the centuries 
I blink my eyes 
Hawks and sparrows race in my waters 
Stingrays are floating 
Across the sky 
Little ones, my sons and my daughters 
Your sweat is salty 
I am why 
I am why 
I am why 
Your sweat is salty 
I am why 
I am why 
I am why
