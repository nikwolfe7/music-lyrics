[x3] Here's my version of it, eternal whirlwind

What's the lesser of two evils:
If a suicide bomber
Made to look pregnant
Manages to kill her target
Or not?

What's the lesser of two evils?

What's the lesser of two evils:
If she kills them
Or dies in vain?

Nature has fixed no limits on our hopes

What's the lesser of two evils?

What's the lesser of two evils:
If the bomb was fake
Or if it was real?

Here's my version of it
Eternal whirlwind
I have fostered since childhood

Well I don't care
Love is all
I dare to drown
To be proven wrong
