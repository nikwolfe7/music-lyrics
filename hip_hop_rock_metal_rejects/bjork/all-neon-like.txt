Not 'til you halo all over me
I'll come over
Not 'til it shimmers 'round your skull
I'll be yours

I weave for you
The marvellous web
Glow in the dark threads
All neon like

The cocoon surrounds you
Embraces all
So you can sleep
Foetus-style

And they will assist us
'Cause we're asking for help
And the luminous beam 
It feeds you,
Henh-yeah!, henh-yeah

The soft distortion
Fills you up
Nourish nourish
Your turtleheart

And they will assist us
'Cause we're asking for help
And the luminous beam 
It feeds you
Henh-yeah!, yeah!

Don't get angry with yourself
Don't, don't get angry with yourself
I'll heal you

With a razorblade 
I'll cut a slit open
And the luminous beam
Feeds you honey, heals you 

Don't get angry with yourself

I'll heal you, i'll heal you 
luminous, i'll heal you
