Who woulda guessed
We'd be doin' it like this
Scandalous
For all the brothers who can't handle this
Thousand Foot takin' up mad space
Too much so that we could wipe out
We got that classic touch
Not in chains
Still representing that same boy
You betcha
The intellectual
It's all about smooth texture
We can be like hooligans and get it on quick
Slickw when the riff hits your
Eardrum and the word sticks
Like think quick
When in doubt who you goin to?
Who you owing to?
On the other end
Who's gonna be your friend?
Just a little something to think about no doubt
Thousand 'bout to let the rhime animal out
We be rocking on till dawn and back again
When you here to jam to the volume back up to ten
I love music
Can't imagine being here without it
Turn it up so your neighbors all hear about it

Thousand Foot with the sound to move ya
We got the rhythm that'll run right through ya
Throw your hands up if the music soothes yah
We rock on like a power booster
Thousand Foot with the sound to move ya
We got the rhythm that'll run right through ya
Never wasting moves never standing still come on
And make way for the rhime animal

Well it's the second verse and
No need for rehearsing
I be the rhime animal
Live and in person
Wanna give a shout to all the real hip hoppers
Who come to all of our shows and represent proper
Turning to those who understand what Thousand Foot do
Cause it ain't entirely easy
In this industry
To pick up a mic and start rapping
And put on guitar straps and start singing
We'll be like "What happened?!"
And yo we just can't get the hang of it
When really it's you can't understand the slang of it
So what if a rock band were to throw a few
Ask a few rascals jumping around
And some finger snaps said uh
If you still don't get it man forget about it
By the time you accept it
We'll be makin a new record
It's all good though
It don't really matter
The Krutch don't care
We down for whatever

Yo everybody swing
Listen to the guitar sing
Check it
