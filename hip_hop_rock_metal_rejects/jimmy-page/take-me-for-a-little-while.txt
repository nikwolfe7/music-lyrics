Now my days are growing cold,
All the memories unfold.
Thinking 'bout the friends we lost,
Wondering how to count the cost,
Now my days are growing cold.

I can hardly wait any longer,
Now the feeling's growing stronger.
Thinking 'bout the times we had,
Good times always turn into bad,
Now my days are growing cold.

Why don't you take me for a little while,
Sing me songs, you know, will make me smile.
Why don't you take me for a little while.

As I watch the rising sun,
I see a new day just begun.
Thinking 'bout the sacrifice,
Wondering how to pay the price,
Now my world is growing cold.

Why don't you take me for a little while,
Sing me songs, you know, will make me smile, make me smile.
Why don't you take me for a little while.

Solo

So now my days are growing cold,
All my memories been told.
Thinking 'bout the dreams we lost,
Wondering how to count the cost.
Now my days are growing cold.

Why don't you take me for a little while,
Sing me songs, you know, will make me smile.
Why don't you take me for a little while,
Sing me songs, you know, will make, me make, me make, me smile.

Why don't you take me for a little while,
Sing me songs, you know, will make me smile.
Why don't you take me for a little while,
Sing me songs, you know, will make, me make, me make, me smile.

Make me smile.

Why don't you take me for a little while,
Sing me songs, you know, will make me, make me, make me smile.
Somebody take me, take me, won't you make me smile...
