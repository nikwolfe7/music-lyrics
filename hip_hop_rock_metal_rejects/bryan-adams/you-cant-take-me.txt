Got to fight another fight - I gotta run another night 
Get it out - check it out 
I'm on my way and I don't feel right 
I gotta get me back - I can't be beat and that's a fact 
It's OK - I'll find a way 
You ain't gonna take me down no way 
Don't judge a thing until you know what's inside it 
Dont' push me - I'll fight it 
Never gonna give in - never gonna give it up no 
If you can't catch a wave then your'e never gonna ride 
You can't come uninvited 
Never gonna give in - never gonna give up no 
You can't take me I'm free 

Why did it all go wrong - I wanna know what's going on 
And what's this holding me 
I'm not where I supposed to be 
I gotta fight another fight 
I gotta fight will all my might 
I'm getting out , so check it out 
Ya, you're in my way 
So you better watch out
