They ride across the mountains
Over their God-given land
Following their destination
Independent barons
Fight behind their king
With a sword in their hands' back to back

The law

People pray
When they ride into nowhere

One dies for all
Dyin' for glory
This was the law of the sword
And
All die for one
Dyin' for glory
A law that was sold for some gold

They were forced to look straight
Into the eye of the storm
Superior forces were waiting
There was a rear man
A traitor to the nation
The odds were not even anymore

The law

People pray
When they ride into nowhereOne dies for all
Dyin' for glory
This was the law of the sword
And
All die for one
Dyin' for glory
A law that was sold for some gold

Thousands were biting
The dust for some glory
In the blood of their horses they stood
For an unreal solution
For sanctification
An order mandatious divine

The law

People pray
When they ride into nowhere

One dies for all
Dyin' for glory
This was the law of the sword
And
All die for one
Dyin' for glory
A law that was sold for some gold

The law
The law
The law
The law

That was sold for some gold
