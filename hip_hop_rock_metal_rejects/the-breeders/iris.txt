Four hours in the pot, one hour out 
It grows and I sleep standing up 
When Iris sleeps over 
What a book she'll write 
Oh last night 
Oh come on, nobody wants that 
Sister, sister, Oh... 
We tried hour by hour 
Hour by hour 
Hour by hour 

Four hours to daylight, four hours and then 
Pour water on me til I live again 
When Iris sleeps over 
It'll be alright 
All last night 
But come on, nobody wants that 
Sister, sister, oh... 
We tried hour by hour 
Hour by hour
