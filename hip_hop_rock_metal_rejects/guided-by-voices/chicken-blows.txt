Chicken blows
I suppose we could have a girl or a boy
And I see what you mean
I'm not here to drink all the beer
In the fridge oh, la la la
In the room oh
In the house
In the place oh, la la la 
That we both oh
So love
Can you sink to the depths lots of ";oh";ing
I don't know
I don't even care
And our lives slip away
In the end we will probably reach
All the way oh, la la la
To the walls oh
over there
Have you flown? oh, la la la
Our courage oh 
Is only a taste
And I'll get paid ooh, ooh
If you'll get laid ooh, ooh
