The scenario is bright
For the King & Carol
What we must tell her
And seasons are slow
So wait we must
And hide from ourselves
Overrun by the rank
Roll over like an egg
And a man-child will kill them
And a quick procession follow
Oh, so now you know
We're all standing in line
For the King & Caroline
And the wisdom they will sell us
And the wisdom they will sell 
Sell
Sell
Sell
Sell, oh, oh
