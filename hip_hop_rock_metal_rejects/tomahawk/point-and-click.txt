Them scumbags
Them faghags
Short eyes
Dope dealers
Drive-bys
Faith healers
I'll be there
Far away
I'm floating above it all
Be there
I'll be there far away
I'll be there for you
I'll prove the Holy Roller's true
The snake charmers
The shoe hangers
I'll show you Sunday strollers too
The gangbangers
Spirit channelers
I wanna be the one for you
I'll be the one
I bought a gun
I wanna be the crowning jewel
To bad they won't believe me son
I'll be there floating above it all
I'll be there flaming
Waiting for you
