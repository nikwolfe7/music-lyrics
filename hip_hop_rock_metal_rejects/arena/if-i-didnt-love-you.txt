So good
When it's good I wanna spend my whole life lovin' you
But I'm tired
And you don't know how close I've come to leaving you
You try my patience
And you race me to the wire
It takes every ounce of my will and desire
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you like crazy
If I didn't love you baby
As much as I do
I'd just walk out the door
I couldn't take it anymore
I wouldn't put up with what you put me through
If I didn't love you
It's hard 
But you won't give up 'till you 
Push me to the wall
But I know
You're the only one who'll be there for me
When I call oh yes you will
I can't help believing 
That it's worth it somehow
Cause I've worked too damn hard
To wanna give up now
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you like crazy
If I didn't love you baby
As much as I do
I'd just walk out the door
I couldn't take it anymore
I wouldn't put up with what you put me through
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you
Nah, If I didn't
If I didn't love you like I do
When you love someone
Nothings black or white
When the riptide runs
There's no wrong or right
I'll sail with you but I'll refuse to drown
So don't you take me down, down
Take me down down
Don't you take me down, down, down
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you
I'd walk out that door
I don't need it anymore
Need to put up with what you put me through
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you like I do o o o
I'd walk out that door
I'm not comin' back no more
No more
