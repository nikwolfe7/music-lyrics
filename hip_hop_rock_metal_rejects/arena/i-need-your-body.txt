I need your body 
I got to have your body 

You whisper my name and I feel my heart 
Beat like it's never gonna stop 
I lose all self control and feel it start 
Your love takes me right to the top 

And the wind, cries out 
Out your name, to, me 
And I feel, no shame 
Feeling this way 

I need your body 
I got to have your body 
Close to me 
Such a temptation 
A burning new sensation's
Flowing through me 
I want you close to me 

You make me feel like we're the only ones 
Who've ever been in love before 
These feelings burn inside me night and day 
You keep me reaching out for more 

And the wind cries out 
Out your name to me 
And I feel no shame 
Feeling this way 

I need your body 
I got to have your body 
Close to me 
Such a temptation 
A burning new sensation 
Flowing through me 
I need you close to me 

And the wind, cries out 
Out your name, to me 
And I feel, no shame 
Feeling this way 

I need your body
