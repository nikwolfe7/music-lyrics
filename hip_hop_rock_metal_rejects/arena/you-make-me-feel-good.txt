Believe me baby
You make me feel good
You make me feel good

What everybody tells me
I'm gonna ruin the day
But I'm just too hung on you baby
To stay away

Maybe I'm in love and that shouldn't be
Maybe I don't know what's good for me
But when you raise your eyes and look that look
I wanna rip out all the pages in my love book

All I wanna do is be with you
You make me feel good
All I wanna see is you with me
You make me feel good

Well I can hear a whisper
When we go by
>

Hey, hey
Let them talk all day if they want to
That's not gonna change what I feel for you
Cause when you pull me close and kiss that kiss
I feel like I've been hit by a ton of brick

All I wanna do is be with you
You make me feel good
All I wanna see is you with me
You make me feel good

Baby you can call me on the line
I'll come running over anytime

All I wanna do is be with you
You make me feel good
Feel good
Believe me baby
You make me feel good
You make me feel good
You make me feel so good
Oh yeah

When you raise your eyes and look that look
I wanna rip out all the pages in my love book

All I wanna do is be with you
You make me feel good
All I wanna see is you with me
You make me feel good

Baby you can call me on the line
I'll come running over anytime

All I wanna do is be with you
You make me feel good
All I wanna see is you with me
You make me feel good
