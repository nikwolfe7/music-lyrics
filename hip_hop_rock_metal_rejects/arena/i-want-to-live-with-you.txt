A man is beaten
And he's leaving now
In the pouring rain
A broken hearted child is watching him
Through the window pane
These are the images that 
Frighten me away
Another grown up game
That I could not play
Thought only pain could come from loving you
But that was yesterday
I wanna live with you
Every single day and night
I think of you
I wanna live with you
Just say the word and I'll do
What you want me to
Now it's the summer of the burning sand
Why do I feel so cold
Every time a woman
Leaves a man
It makes me feel so old
I tried so hard to fight the
Longing in the night
All most convinced myself that
I would be alright
But in the end the wall came tumbling down
In need you in my life
My life
I wanna live with you
Every single day and night
I think of you
I wanna live with you
Just say the word and I'll do
What you want me to ooh
If love means anything
Then you'll know this is all I can do
Cast my fate to the wind
To live with you
I wanna live with you
I tried so hard to fight the
Longing in the night
All most convinced myself that
I would be alright
But in the end the walls came tumbling down
I need you in my life
My life
I wanna live with you
Every single day and night I think of you
I wanna live with you
Say the word and I'll do
What you want me to 
I wanna live with you baby
Day and night I think of you
I wanna live with you
Say the world and I'll do what you want me to
Ooh I wanna live with you baby
What do I have to do
