Gather your modalistic interchange ability, 
it would demandno reliability 
Holism; partly modified, partly unified 
Seems like you are subtle to the last 

Faith and honour, portrayed liike a bench 
by which slaughter is proceeded 
Insurrectonal by wrench, 
no more prosperity for you, 
it took all you ever had 

Return my Faustian Spirit of the Earth 
Grace completes nature, yet abolishes it 
It shows how you're constantly 
being on alert 
Ambiguity; like a vernacular pendulum, 
back and forth 

Redemption; you should never judge 
me and my children, 
omissioned by your failures only 
Attempting to touch your 
erroneous ideology 
For all what I am worth; return my 
Faustian Spirit of the Earth
