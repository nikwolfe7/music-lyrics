As the flies and the wilds 
gathered around Tens Horns 
The beasts from all directions 
Fell the call of their master 
The winds are changing 
The sun is staying upon 
The stars are ever glowing 
The timehad come you will see... 

Rising up the mountains, 
Churning all the oceans 

There is nowhere to hide 
The unleashed poor think they can 
Escape but there is only one way 
In fact which leads towards 
the wide opened fangs 
Made of infernal flames 
See the floating of the millions of creatures 
Towards their reconciled destiny 
And blasting all the hopes 

See what is the reality in itself: 
Everything is already dead! 

The ecstatic trance-dance of Mahakala 
Burning down the worlds 
Leading by the anger against all 
That belongs to God 

Now its time for to the world 
To see a man with opened eyes 
Now its time to realize 
We tell ourselves the best of lies 
Now its time to see the fact 
We all are the unity 
Now its time for us 
To deliberate our aim
