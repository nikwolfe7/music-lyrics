Midnight wish blow me a kiss
I'll blow one to you
Make like this
Try to pretend it's true
Show me all your favorite things
Show you all mine too
Make a wish
I'll give it all to you
Hold on to your promises
Hold on to mine too
Caught like this
I'll turn it in with you
Fall apart my bleeding beating heart
Nothing left to do
Once in love
I'll be the death of you
