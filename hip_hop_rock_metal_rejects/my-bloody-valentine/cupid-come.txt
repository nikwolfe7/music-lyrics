Cupid come from coffee cup
Sickly heavy heart
Semi-set adrift in your
Lifted sugar eye
Come back down I'm waiting here
And lick me with your fire
Connected silver tounges
Our lips beside
Everytime I look at you
Pins me to the ground
Mirror me your memories please
And let me help you down
Swallow me into your bed
With glimpses of your thighs
Forget your vanity
Come cupid come
