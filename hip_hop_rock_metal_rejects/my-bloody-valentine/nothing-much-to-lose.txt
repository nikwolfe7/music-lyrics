Your soft hand
But I don't understand
Your big brown eyes
With a small small heart
I'll come down, down, down
Oh, you don't know what you found
Don't, don't walk walk walk away
Take me
I will remember you
Long dark hair
Nothing much to lose
Help you crawl crawl crawl
Oh, I wanna see it all
Eyes asked why why why, too late
