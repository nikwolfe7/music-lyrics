What happened then
And again
And then again
And again
Loved me black and blue
No more sorry
Flesh and bone
Not alone
You're not alone
Waiting by the telephone
Whatever you do
Don't call daddy
In my head
And everywhere
And everywhere
And everywhere
Fingerprints of you
Filthy daddy
Wash and mend
And wash and mend
Some kind of friend
You septic heart and deadly hand
Loved me black and blue
No more sorry
