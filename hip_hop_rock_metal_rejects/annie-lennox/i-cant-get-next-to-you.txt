Strong/Whitfield
I can turn the grey sky blue
And I can make it rain
Whenever I want it to
And I can build a castle
From a single grain of sand
And I can make a ship sail
On dry land
But my life is incomplete
And I'm so blue
'Cause I can't get next to you
*I can't get next to you,babe
I can't get next to you
I can't get next to you,babe
I can't get next to you
I can fly
Like a bird in the sky
I can buy anything
That money can buy
I can turn a river into a raging fire
I can live forever if I so desire
But I don't want it all these things I can do
'Cause I can't get next to you
*Repeat
I can turn back the hands of time
You better believe I can
I can make the season change
Just by the wave of my hand
I can change anything from one to two
The thing I wanna do the most I'm unable to do
I'm an unhappy woman with all the powers I possess
'Cause man you're the key to my happiness
'Cause I can't get to next to you
Ooh you're blowin' my mind
'Cause I can't get next to you
Can't you see these tears I'm cryin'
I can't get next to you
Oh it's you that I need
I gotta get next to you
Can't you see these tears I'm cryin'
Can't get next to you
I,I,I,I,I,I
Can't get next to you
I,I,I,I,I,I
Can't get next to you
