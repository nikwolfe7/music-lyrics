Substitute my gloom with happiness 
substitute my sickness with health 
substitute my enemies with real good friends 
Morphine & chocolate are my substitute, substitutes 
morphine & chocolate can bring me up 
can warm my heart whenever I want it 
and every once in a while when I stop and think 
morphine & chocolate are my substitute, substitutes 
And you can say "hey, we've really come a long way" 
and you can say "say, it can only be this way" 
but, you might be careful, it really, it really come a long way 
And you can say "hey, it can only be this way" 
but, you might be careful, it really hurts when it's real 
you might be careful, it really hurts when it's real 
you might be careful, it really hurts when it's real 
you'll go down, down, down, ooh 
Set the alarm clock, baby, 
don't you miss the sun 
I'm feeling really warm hearted baby 
don't you know I'm feeling like someone 
I'm fearing for my heart 
Morphine & chocolate could never substitute my art! 
and that's real love baby 
and that's real love baby 
and that's real love baby
