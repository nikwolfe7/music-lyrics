Lyrics Embury - Music Embury
Previous times you stuck by me
Relations fine undeniably
Mutual trust and honesty
The essential recipe
There's two sides to a coin
Opinions numbered many
Yet resolve came with ease
Compromised and regret - free
Then the vhange of expression
A unit of friends and the chance to be free
Your thoughts on these cast a jealous light
A concensus of hate to accompany
A vindictive acid taste
Flows from your chalice
Valued friendships tainted
Martyr of malice
Then the final straw
Violent intimidation
Your self acclaimed pacification
Brushed aside for self-gratification
Blatant ignorance - martyr of malice
