Lyrics Embury/Greenway - Music Embury
Your self-determined place of value
Think before you act!
Can you justifiably criticise
A situations development
Sometimes there's only a single path
Which we have to walk
You realise before you even speak
That we're standing in a one-way street
Why should we retreat? - To satisfy your gain?
Think hard - tell me
What's your actual thoughts?
Could you even give your brain the time of day?
I'm not defending things I've said or done
But let he without sin
Cast the first begrudging stone
If the truth be known
you desire to judge unchallenged
and revel in the according attention
