I want you
To want me
I'm goin' crazy
Knowin' he will be your lover tonight
And when he comes,
I'll let you go
I'll just pretend as you walked out the door
Oh no
I can't sleep
Oh no
I'm goin' crazy with love
Over you...

I need you,
To need me
I want to hold you
But you're holdin' someone else in your arms
When I close my eyes
I see your face
I'm just not sure
How much my heart can erase
Oh no
I can't think ooh....
Oh no
I'm goin' crazy with love
Over you

Oh honey
Oh sugar

Oh no
I can't sleep anymore baby
Oh no
I can't think anymore baby
Oh no
I'm goin' crazy with love
Over you.....
