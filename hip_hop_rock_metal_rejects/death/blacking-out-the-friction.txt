I don't mind the weather
I've got scarves and caps and sweaters
I've got long johns under slacks for blustery days.

I think that it's brainless to assume that making changes to your window's view will give a new perspective. 

And the hardest part is yet to come 

I don't mind restrictions or if you're blacking out the friction
It's just an escape it's overrated anyways

The hardest part is yet to come
When you will cross the country alone.
