[Agony] I am pain 
I am real. I'm not a dream 
I'm the chain around your neck as you scream 

Surrender now 
You can't beat death at his ruthless game 
Make your bow 
Hang your head in shame 

[Me] I can't believe there is no way out... 
[Agony] You'll find you are wrong 
[Me] You fill me with doubt... 
[Agony] You were never that strong 

[Agony] I am pain 
I am the wound that never heals 
It's all in vain 
No compromise, no deals... 

[Me] I can't believe this is the end 
[Agony] It's written in stone 
[Me] Where are my friends? 
[Agony] You have always been alone! 

[Rage] Pain! We lead 
We hide as the pain leaves the rage inside 
Motion personified alpha 
Being here, welcomed by...a sane mind 
A travelled lie 

[Agony] I am pain 
I am the end, I am your wraith 
Nothing remains 
I'm the loss of hope and faith 

[Me] I can't believe there is no way out... 
[Agony] You'll I find you are wrong 
[Me] You fill me with doubt... 
[Agony] You were never that strong 

[Rage] We lead, we hide as the pain leaves the rage inside 
Motion personified alpha 
Being here, welcomed by...a sane mind 
A travelled lie 
All the time, I had waited with rage 
All the time, I was promised my salvation 

[Love] I can't accept this, we will find a way 
Out of this cesspool of doom and dismay 
Beyond this dejection there's beauty and grace 
A glorious future we long to embrace 

[Rage] Pain! All the time, I have waited with rage 
Motion personified alpha 
All the time, I was promised my salvation
