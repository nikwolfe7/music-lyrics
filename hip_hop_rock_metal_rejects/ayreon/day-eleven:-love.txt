[Me] Friday night, I had a few 
There she was, out of the blue 
Thunderstruck, nailed to the floor 
I couldn't move, couldn't talk...anymore 

[Love] Of all these guys it's you she desires 
Secretly her heart is on fire 
Waiting for you to ask her to dance 
Go ahead, make your move...now's your chance 

[Passion] Do it right, do it right, we ain't got all night 
Do it now, do it now, I think you know how 
[Pride] Let it out, let it out, now don't mess about 
Let her in, let her in, let the party begin! 

[Me] There I was, nervous and shy 
Struck with awe as I caught her eye 
I mustered up courage and walked her way 
Figuring out what to do...what to say 

[Love] Her heart sings as she sees you come near 
The music fades, the crowd disappears 
She weeps in silence as you pass her by 
And she's wondering why...oh why 

[Passion] Do it right, do it right, we ain't got all night 
Do it now, do it now, I think you know how 
[Pride] Let it out, let it out, now don't mess about 
Let her in, let her in, let the party begin!

[Agony] Remember your father, well you're just like him 
Nothing but violence and fury within 
Remember your mother, so lonely and sad 
This will be her fate if you treat her as bad 

[Fear] You're afraid she might turn you down 
All your hopes dashed to the ground 
Nobody loved you, nobody will 
Why should you even try...but still... 

[Me] Friday night, I had a few 
[Wife] There was no need to talk 
[Me] There she was, out of the blue 
[Wife] We just started to walk 
[Me] Hand in hand, we took the floor 
[Wife] And we danced, and we danced, and we danced 
[Me] I could move, I could talk...even more... 

[Passion] Do it right, do it right, we ain't got all night 
Do it now, do it now, I think you know how 
[Pride] Let it out, let it out, now don't mess about 
Let her in, let her in, let the party begin!

[Agony] Remember your father, well you're just like him 
Nothing but violence and fury within 
Remember your mother, so lonely and sad 
This will be her fate if you treat her as bad

[Passion] Do it right, do it right, we ain't got all night 
Do it now, do it now, I think you know how 
[Pride] Let it out, let it out, now don't mess about 
Let her in, let her in, let the party begin!

[Agony] Remember your father, well you're just like him 
Nothing but violence and fury within 
Remember your mother, so lonely and sad 
This will be her fate if you treat her as bad

[Passion] Do it right, do it right, we ain't got all night 
Do it now, do it now, I think you know how 
[Pride] Let it out, let it out, now don't mess about 
Let her in, let her in, let the party begin!
