C'mon, c'mon, c'mon 
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon 
I wanna know your name 

I never knew that love could put a spell on me 
Then you walked into the room 
What to do 
Should I let my package show 
Or should I try and play it cool 

I've been foolin' 
I've been playin' 
For so long my heart's been waitin' 
To finally love someone like you 
Now my heart's anticipatin' 
All the love we could be makin' 
I gotta get this message through 

Chorus 
I wanna know your name 
I wanna know everything about you 
Driving me insane 
I wanna know your name 
How can I let you know 
I wanna get right next to you 
Checkin' the way you flow 
I wanna know your name 

Tell me now 
Where have you been all my life 
Are you real or just a dream 
You know I'm down 
Anything you want to do 
So won't you come and go with me 

I can't take it 
Please don't fake it 
Here's my heart 
Now don't you break it 
'Cause you know I'm all about you 
I am itchin' 
Can't deny it 
There's no creams out there can't fight it 
What can I say, what can I do 

Chorus 

I want you 
I need you 
I really like to please you 
You got it 
I need it 
It's time that you believe it 

You lookin' so fine tonight, baby 
I just wanna drive you around in my Viper 
Yeah 
We gonna speed through town, the top down 
Your legs straddling the seat 
Oh man 
What's your name, what's your name, what's your name 
I wanna know your name 
What's your name, what's your name 
What's your name, what's your name 

Chorus 2x 

What's your name, what's your name 
What's your name, what's your name
