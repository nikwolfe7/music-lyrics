I am what I am 
I am my own special creation 
So come take a look 
Give me the hook or the ovation 
It's my world 
And I want to have a little pride in 
My world 
And it's not a place I have to hide in 
Life's not worth a damn 
Till you can say 
I am what I am 

I am what I am 
I don't want praise I don't want pity 
I bang my own drum 
Some think it's noise I think it's pretty 
And so what if I love each sparkle and each spangle 
Why not try to see things from a different angle 
Your life is a sham 
Till you can shout out 
I am what I am 
I am what I am 

I am what I 
I am what I 
I am what I 
I am what I 
Somebody
Repeat

I am what I am 
And what I am needs no excuses 
I deal my own deck 
Sometimes the ace sometimes the deuces 
It's one life and there's no return and no deposit 
One life so it's time to open up your closet 
Life's not worth a damn till you can shout out 
I am what I am 
I am what I am 

Somebody

I am what I 
I am what I 
I am what I 
I am what I 
Repeat

I am what I am 
And what I am needs no excuses 
I deal my own deck 
Sometimes the ace sometimes the deuces 
It's one life and there's no return and no deposit 
One life so it's time to open up your closet 
Life's not worth a damn till you can shout out 
I am what I am 

I am I am I am 
Good
I am I am I am 
Strong
I am I am I am 
Worthy
I am I am I am 
I belong 
I am I am I am 
Useful
I am I am I am 
True
I am I am I am 
Somebody
I am as good as you
