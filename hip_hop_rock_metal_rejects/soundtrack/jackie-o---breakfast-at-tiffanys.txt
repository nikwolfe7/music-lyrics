[night]

You'll say that we've got nothing in common 
No common ground to start from 
And we're falling apart 
You'll say the world has come between us 
Our lives have come between us 
Still I know you just don't care 

I see you - the only one who knew me 
And now your eyes see through me 
I guess I was wrong 
So what now? It's plain to see we're over, 
And I hate when things are over 
When so much is left undone 

And I said what about "Breakfast at Tiffany's? 
She said, "I think I remember the film, 
And as I recall, I think, we both kinda liked it." 
And I said, "Well, that's the one thing we've got." 

One thing we've got 
ha-ha
ha-ha
ha-ha
One thing we've got
