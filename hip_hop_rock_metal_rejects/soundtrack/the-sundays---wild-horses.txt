Childhood living is easy to do 
The things you wanted I bought them for you 
Graceless lady, you know who I am, 
You know I can't let you slide through my hands 

Wild Horses, 
Couldn't drag me away, 
Wild, wild horses, 
Couldn't drag me away... 

I watched you suffer a dull, aching pain 
Now you decided to show me the same 
No sweeping exits or offstage lines, 
Can make me feel bitter or treat you unkind 

Wild Horses, 
Couldn't drag me away,Wild, wild horses, 
Couldn't drag me away... 

I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie, 
I have my freedom but I don't have much time 
Faith has been broken tears must be cried, 
Let's do some living after we die 

Wild Horses, 
Couldn't drag me away, 
Wild, wild horses, 
We'll ride them someday 

Wild Horses, 
Couldn't drag me away, 
Wild, wild horses, 
We'll ride them someday
