Hard time here and everywhere you go 
Times is harder than ever been before 

And the people are driftin' from door to door 
Can't find no heaven, I don't care where they go 

Hear me tell you people, just before I go 
These hard times will kill you just dry long so 

Well, you hear me singin' my lonesome song 
These hard times can last us so very long 

If I ever get off this killin' floor 
I'll never get down this low no more 
No-no, no-no, I'll never get down this low no more 

And you say you had money, you better be sure 
'Cause these hard times will drive you from door to door 

Sing this song and I ain't gonna sing no more 
Sing this song and I ain't gonna sing no more 
These hard times will drive you from door to door
