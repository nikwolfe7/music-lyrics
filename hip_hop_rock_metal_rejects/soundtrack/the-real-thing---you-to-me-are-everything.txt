Thanks to Julie  
      James for submitting the lyrics 

I would take the stars out of the sky for you 
Stop the rain from falling if you asked me to. 
I'd do anything for you 
your wish is my command 

I could move a mountain when your hand is in my hand. 
Words cannot express how much you mean to me. 
There must be some other way to make you see. 
If it takes my heart and soul 
you know I'd pay the price. 
Everything that I possess I'd gladly sacrifice. 

Oh you to me are everything 
The sweetest song that I could sing 
Oh baby 
Oh baby 
To you I guess I'm just a clown 
Who picks you up each time you're down 
Oh baby 
Oh baby 
You give me just a taste of love 
To build my hopes upon. 
You know you've got the power girl 
To keep me holding on. 
So now you've got the best of me 
Come on and take the rest of me 
Oh baby 

Though you're close to me 
we seem so far apart. 
Maybe given time you'll have a change of heart. 
If it takes forever 
girl then I'm prepared to wait. 
The day you give your love to me won't be a day too late 

Oh you to me are everything. 
The sweetest song that I could sing. 
Oh baby 
Oh baby 
To you I guess I'm just a clown 
Who picks you up each time you're down 
Oh baby 
Oh baby 
You give me just a taste of love 
To build my hopes upon. 
You know you've got the power girl 
To keep me holding on. 
So now you've got the best of me 
Come on and take the rest of me 
Oh baby 

Oh you to me are everything. 
the sweetest song that I could sing. 
Your the sweetest song that I could sing. 
Oh baby oh baby 
Oh baby yes I need you baby 
You to me are everything. 
The sweetest song that I could sing. 
Oh baby you are everything to me 
Oh baby cant you see 
You to me are everything. 
The sweetest song that I could sing. 
Your the sweetest song that I could sing. 
Oh baby 
Oh baby you're everything 
You to me are everything. 
The sweetest song that I could sing. 
Oh baby 
Oh baby your the sweetest song 
You to me are everything. 
The sweetest song that I could sing.
