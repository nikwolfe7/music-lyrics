Do you wanna ride 

[Intro] 
Whassup baby? 
You wanna get freaky? 
Oh, wanna get freaky 
That's right 

I'll pick you up at about 5:30 
Take you to my house, we can get dirty 
See I ain't got no shame in my game 
Get you on the bed, make you scream my name 

Girl don't you hold back 
Cuz my lovin' is all there 
See baby, I  can do it like this 
Side to side, up and down 
Round and round, pound for pound 
Say it 

1 - 	Do you wanna ride 
	Do you wanna get freaky 
	Baby, let me come inside 
	We can both get nasty 

 	Do you wanna ride 
	Do you wanna get freaky 
	Baby, let me come inside 
	We can both get nasty 

Kissin' on your lips and baby kissin' on your thighs 
See, I'm the nigga from Tennessee and baby that's my thing 
Oh what I wanna do to you 
Get next to you, wanna rub you 
Do all the things your man won't do 
Straight half bangin' boogie 

All night long baby 
Break it out till early dawn 
Baby wanna hear you moan 
Hurry up take it off 
So I can come inside, yeah, yeah

Do ya, do ya, do ya 

Repeat 1 

We can go, oh girl 
Up and down 
Up and down, baby 
Round and round 
Round and round 
Pound for pound 
Pound for pound 
All night long 

We can go 
Up and down 
I'll take you there with me 
Round and round 
Together baby we will see 
Pound for pound 
I'll be with you 
All night long 

Repeat 1 until fade
