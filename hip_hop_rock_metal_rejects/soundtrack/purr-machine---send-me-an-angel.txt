the lyrics

Do you believe in heaven above
Do you believe in love
Don't tell a lie; don't be false or untrue
It all comes back to you
Open fire!
On my burning heart
I've never been lucky in love
My defenses are down; a kiss or a frown
I can't survive on my own

If a girl walks in and carves her name on my heart
I'll turn and run away
Every day we've all been led astray
It's hard to be lucky in love
It gets in your eyes
It's making you cry
Don't know what to do don't know what to do
You're looking for love
Calling heaven above

Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now

Empty dreams can only disappoint
In a room behind your smile
But don't give up
Don't give up
You can be lucky in love
It gets in your eyes
It's making you cry
Don't know what to do don't know what to do
You're looking for love
Callin' heaven above

Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
