Saturday night I was downtown 
Working for the FBI 
Sitting in a nest of bad men 
Whiskey bottles piling high 

Bootlegging boozer on the west side 
Full of people who are doing wrong 
Just about to call up the DA man 
When I heard this woman singing a song 

A pair of 45's made me open my eyes 
My temperature started to rise 
She was a long cool woman in a black dress 
Just a 5-9 beautiful tall 
With just one look I was a bad mess 
'Cause that long cool woman had it all 

I saw her heading to the table 
Well a tall walking big black cat 
When Charlie said I hope that you're able, boy 
Well I'm telling you she knows where it's at 
Well then suddenly we heard the sirens 
And everybody started to run 
Jumping under doors and tables 
Well I heard somebody shooting a gun 

Well the DA was pumping my left hand 
And she was holding my right 
Well I told her, "Don't get scared 
'Cause you're gonna be spared" 
Well I'm gonna be forgiven 
If I wanna spend my living 
With a long cool woman in a black dress 
Just a 5-9 beautiful tall 
With just one look I was a bad mess 
'Cause that long cool woman had it all 
Had it all, had it all, had it all...
