I fly
i soar
This I adore
And then like a locomotive
The sound of your sorrow comes.
I'm tired of the way it feels
I only apologized to you to make you feel better
But I think I've outgrown that horsehair sweater.
I'd rather be alone
You're bout as reliable as paper shoes in bad weathers,
But pain will roll off like water on feathers.
You'd fly,you'd soar
But then like a locomotive
The sound of your sorrow comes.
I'm tired of the way it feels
I only apologized to you to make you feel better
But I think I've outgrown that horsehair sweater.
I'd rather on my own
You're bout as reliable as paper shoes in bad weathers,
But pain will roll off like water on feathers.
