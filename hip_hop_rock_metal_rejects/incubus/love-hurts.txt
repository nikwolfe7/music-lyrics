Tonight we drink to youth
And holding fast to truth
I don't want to lose what I had as a boy.
My heart still has a beat
But love is now a feat.
As common as a cold day in LA.
Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder
Is there a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing?

Love hurts...
But sometimes it's a good hurt
And it feels like I'm alive.
Love sings,
When it transcends the bad things.
Have a heart and try me,
'cause without love I won't survive.

I'm fettered and abused,
I stand naked and accused
Should I surface this one man submarine?
I only want the truth
So tonight we drink to youth!
I'll never lose what I had as a boy.
Sometimes when I'm alone I wonder
Is there a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing?

Love hurts...
But sometimes it's a good hurt
And it feels like I'm alive.
Love sings,
When it transcends the bad things.
Have a heart and try me,
'cause without love I won't survive.
