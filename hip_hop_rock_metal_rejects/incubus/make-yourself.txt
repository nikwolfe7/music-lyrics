If I hadn't made me, I would've been made somehow  
If I hadn't assembled myself, I'd have fallen apart by now  
If I hadn't made me, I'd be more inclined to bow  
Powers that be, would have swallowed me up  
But that's more than I can allow  
Bow, aww yeah  
If you let them make you, they'll make you paper mache  
At a distance you're strong, until the wind comes  
Then you crumble and blow away  
If you let them fuck you, there will be no fore-play  
Rest assured, they'll screw you complete  
Til your ass is blue and gray  
You should make amends with you  
If only for better health, better health  
But if you really want to live  
Why not try, and make yourself  
Make yourself  
Make yourself  
If I hadn't made me, I'd have fallen apart by now  
I won't let them make me, It's more than I can allow  
So when I make me, I won't be paper mache  
And if I fuck me, I'll fuck me my own way  
POW, fuck me in my own way  
POW, fuck me in my own way  
POW, fuck me in my own way  
Fuck me in my own way  
You should make amends with you  
If only for better health, better health  
But if you really want to live  
Why not try, and make yourself  
Make yourself  
Make yourself  
Make yourself  
Make yourself
