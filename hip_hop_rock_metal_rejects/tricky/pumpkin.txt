Pumpkin 
you're hollow within 
More how I'm to slowly 
let their harm 
Give us some 
It's sad until 
Like flowers untamed 
Shine out ends 
I find what will make him 
Love me 
Life is our find 
Hollow is he 


I can't breathe and I can't see 
MTV moves too fast, I refuse to understand 
You go your way and I'll see mine 
Feels like wasted time 
And it feels like I must be blind 
How'd you like yourself? 
You don't know yourself 


To a hollow kind, don't mind 
Love is some of you 
Don't dabble 
in fall of failure 
How bad, ooh, ooh 


I smell of she and I fail to be 
Well anyway,well anyway,well anyway 

See how high 
Go on 


I can't see and I can't breathe 
I can't see and I can't breathe 
I can't see and I can't breathe 
I can't see and I can't breathe 
Well anyway, well anyway
