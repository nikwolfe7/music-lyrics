Woah, ohh

Welcome to the greatest show
Greatest show on earth
You've never seen before
Here the fairytale unfolds

What's behind the smoke and glass?
Painted faces, everybody wears a mask
Are you selling them your soul?
Well you'll be left out in the cold

Is it all blue skies
Fun and games untill you fall
Then you're left without anyone at all
You're riding on a shooting star
With a smile upon your face
But soon the shine fades

And you're left out all alone
Wondering where did they all go?
Oooh

Been jaded, hated,
Who'll be around when the limelight's faded?
Been shut down, pushed out
Made to smile when I wanted to frown

Always taking a bow
Always working the crowd
Always breaking new ground
Always playing the clown
Who'll be sticking it out?
Who'll be staying around
When the lights go down?
