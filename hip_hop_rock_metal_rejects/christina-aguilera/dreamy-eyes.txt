I'm reaching out to touch you 
In the middle of the night 
And I don't know if I've been sleeping 
But I hold my pillow tight 
Are you real or are you my imagination playin games 
I can set you free 
You'll always be my eternal flame 

Your dreamy eyes 
They just wont say good-bye 
Well it must be my fate cause I just cant escape 
And the passion never dies 
Oh, dreamy eyes 
No matter how I cry 
I just can't reach you dreamy eyes 

You're a vision of tomorrow 
And a ghost from yesterday 
And I'll be trying not to let you 
Take my breath away 
You're a summer breeze 
That comes and goes 
But somehow lingers on 
Tell me how can I forget you 
If you're never really gone 

What do I have to do 
To get that close to you 
And your your dreamy eyes 
Oh, I try so hard to release you 
I just keep seeing through dreamy eyes
