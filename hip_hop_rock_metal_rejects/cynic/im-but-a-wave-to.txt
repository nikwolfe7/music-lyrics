As one I'll meet the mortal memories
Reliving seeking silence
And know that I as just a shell outside
Have sacred joys inside me
No fear, nor fight, comforting silent side
So free, through flight, comforting silence
CHORUS
So I call on
Sri cosmic sea, all is within you
As in a dream, I'm but a wave to...
Infinity within thy consciousness
An ever expanding sphere
Immortal spark ignites
Spreads by the air of bliss
Embracing warmth that heals
No fear, nor fight, comforting silence
So free, through flight, comforting silent side
CHORUS
