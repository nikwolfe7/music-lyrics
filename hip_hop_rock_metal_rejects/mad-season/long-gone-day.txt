So much blood I'm starting to drown
Runs from cold to colder
Time to time the skies come down
To help me lose my way
Tears and lies for answers
You and open veins, God knows I'm gone
Girl I just want you to
Come on down

Lord it's a storm and I'm heading to fall
These sins are mine and I've done wrong, oh babe
Come on down

Long gone day
Mmmm, who ever said
We wash away with the rain

See you all from time to time
Isn't it so strange
How far away we all are now
Am I the only one who remembers that summer
Oh, I remember
Everyday each time the place was saved 
The music that we made
The wind has carried all of that away

Long gone day
Mmmm, who ever said
We wash away with the rain

So many tears I'm starting to drown
The rain in heaven's all come down
Silver spoons affix the crown
The luckless ones are broken
Fears and lies for answers
You and open flames
God knows I'm gone
And I just want you to 
Come on down

Lord it's a storm and I'm heading to fall
These sins are mine and I've done wrong
I want you to, oh I just want you to
Come on down

I fear again, like then, I've lost my way
And shout to God to bring my sunny day
