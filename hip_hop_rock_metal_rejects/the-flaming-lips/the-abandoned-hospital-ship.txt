Well it took some time
cause its a lot
God, it's a bunch
It's such a big, old, black golden buzz

And yeah it took some help
with lots of machines, the experts could tell
with their equipment pushed to the max...

And sure it seems easy now but I tell you what
We were perplexed finding the needle
in the needle's disguise

And now that it's conceived, the station has all
settled down, and I'm sort of relieved, and I'm 
getting over it now...
