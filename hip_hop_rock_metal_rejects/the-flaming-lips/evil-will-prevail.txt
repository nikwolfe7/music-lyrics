With Loving hands and their arms are stretched so wide they can't 
seem to take a breath knowing evil will prevail, and a million people
seems
like a lot, and a million people can't be wrong...

With loving smiles, and their mouths are stretched so wide they can't
even
take a breath, knowing evil will prevail, and the magic bullet is the 
glowing mother ship, and the mother zaps you dead...

with loving hands knowing evil will prevail
knowing evil will prevail
knowing that evil will prevail
knowing evil will prevail
knowing that evil will always win...
