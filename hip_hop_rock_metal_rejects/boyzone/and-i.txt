It's been a while how have you been doing
      Do you over think about me and you and
      All the things we used to do
      The times that we shared
      Well I've been looking for love and affection
      It's brought me back in your direction
      Even though we've been apart
      Your part of my soul

      Ok I know I know I was a fool
      A fool To lose my faith in you
      But girl before you go
      I want you to know

      That I think of you every day, baby
      And I can't seem to get away 
      from these feelings
      And I, I need to tell you some how
      That I need your love right now

      Looking back I can see things clearly
      The mistakes that I paid for dearly
      Taking love for granted only leaves you alone
      Well if we talked you would understand that
      Time has made me a better man and
      With your love behind me there's nowhere I can't go

      So take a chance Just take a chance on me
      And you'll see It's where you need to be
      If your heart it tells you so
      You'll know what I know

      CHORUS

      Right now is the time for both of us
      To put aside our differences and trust
      All the words I never used to say
      Now I've found a way
      Now I've found a way

      That I think of you every day, baby
      I think of you, I think of you, baby
      And I can't seem to get away from these feelings
      I can't seem to, I can't seem to, get away, get away
      And I, I need to tell you some how
      Some how
      That I need your love Your love, right now
      Right now

      That I think of you every day, baby
      baby
      And I can't seem to get away from these feelings
      I can't seem..
      From these feelings
      And I, I need to tell you some how
      That I need your love right now

      I said I need your love right now..
