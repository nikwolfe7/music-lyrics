How can you accept social suppresion
This weak state of mind in our time
I demand release from hypocrisy
I'd rather die than be held down,  forced down
Freedom or fire
Freedom or fire
I'm on the threshold of revolution
I'd rather burn than be held down,  forced down
Freedom or fire
Freedom or fire
Unrestrained determination
Set ablaze for liberation
Locked in chains of this sovereignty
Let me be 'cause I long to be
Free!   Free!
Unrestrained determination
Set ablaze for liberation
Set ablaze
Set ablaze
Freedom or fire
