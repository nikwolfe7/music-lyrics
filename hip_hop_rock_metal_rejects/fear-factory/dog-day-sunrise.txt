Dog Day Sunrise
Every day of my life
I'm working on a scheme
Working overtime underground
Girls work under floors
The failures tend the moors
But once the seem is cut
They find out what is learned
Dog Day Sunrise

Dog Day Sunrise
Drag your feet through hollow streets
Drag your feet through hollow streets
Drag your feet through hollow streets
Drag your feet through hollow streets
Dog Day Sunrise

Valentine has shining eyes

My valentine has shining eyes
