Falling victim from neglect
Designed thoughts and intellect
Forgotten and displaced
The crux of my dismay
I feel nothing
I am nothing
I feel nothing
Nothing
Hoow deep I descend
Until I reach my end
How deep I descend
Deeper into this abyss
Weighted down and sinking fast
Life did not offer me
More than false destiny
I feel nothing
I am nothing
I feel nothing
Nothing
How deep I descend
Until I Reach my end
How deep I descend
I am nothing
I feel nothing
I am nothing
I feel nothing
Nothing
Nothing...
How deep I descend
Until I reach my end
How deep I descend
