Hi-Tech Hate 

These weapons of mass destruction 
Around our world, threat to us all! 
Operated by fears, cold over years 
Systematic death, terminal breath! 

Leaders of our time just stand behind 
An arsenal to end us all! 
Fighting a war, we can't ignore 
Destined to fall, cowards to all!... 

We are losing, weapons controlling 
This is the hour of your reckoning 

These weapons of mass destruction 
Around our world, threat to us all! 
Fighting a war, we can't ignore 
Destined to fall, cowards to all!... 

We are losing, weapons controlling 
This is the hour of your reckoning 

No more arsenal threatens all 
Heading for a downfall 
Mass destruction, mass destruction 
Mass destruction for all
