Consumed with memories that preceded today
Given a chance to bereave life that's slipping away
Suffered through tragedy of my slow decay
Deceptive tendencies dragged my soul away
All that I know there was no God for me
Force that shatters all, absence of mortality
Revive all my fears
Revive wasted tears
Revive void within
Revive once again. . .
Forsaken by destiny, forsaken by my own mind
I must remove my skin to see belief in your eyes
All that I know there was no God for me
Force that shatters all, absence of mortality
Revive all my fears
Revive wasted tears
Revive void within
Revive once again. . .
Reach for the sky
Touch the sky
Revive a hope
For mankind
