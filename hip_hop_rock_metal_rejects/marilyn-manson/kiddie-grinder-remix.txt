I am the face of piss and shit and sugar
I do a crooked little dance with my funny little monkey
What I want what I want is just your children
I hate what I have become to escape what I hated being

Calliopenis envy from your daddy
You're not gonna hear what he don't want to hear
What I say disgusts him
He wants to be me and that scares him
 Let's do a funny little dance with my funny little monkey 
The black keys

Actually, he loves you

Here is my real head
Here is my real head
I wear this fucking mask because you cannot handle me
Here is my real head

They try to blink me not to think me
Don't want to bring me out
I am the rotten teeth my fists are lined with suckers
My prison skins an eyesore-mirror-sketch-pad
I am your son
Your dad
You fag
I am your fad

Here is my real head
Here is my real head
I wear this fucking mask because you cannot handle me
Here is my real head

I have to take your voice and and stick my fingers in it
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
Here is my real head
Here is my real head
Here is my real head
Here is my real head
I wear this fucking mask because you cannot handle me
Here is my real head
I wear this fucking mask because you cannot handle me
Here is my real head

I have to take your voice and and stick my fingers in it
Fuck fuck!
Here is my real head
Here is my real head
Here is my real head
