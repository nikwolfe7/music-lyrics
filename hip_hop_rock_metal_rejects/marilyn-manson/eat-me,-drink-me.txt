In the wasteland
On the way to the Red Queen...
It's no wonder our stage clothes
Have dreams to be famous.
The trees in the courtyard
Are painted in blood,
So I've heard.
She hangs the headless
Upside down to drain.

EAT ME, DRINK ME
EAT ME, DRINK ME
This is only a game,
This is only a game

I was invited to
A beheading today.
I thought I was a butterfly
Next to your flame.
A rush of panic and
The lock has been raped.
This is only a game,
This is only a game...

But then our star rushes in,
Feeling like a child and looking
Like a woman...
She has been forecast with an
Attempt to kill herself,
But the ending didn't test well.

So picking my skin
And my scales.
I see my horror
Reflected in the
Sundown of your
Blank stare.

EAT ME, DRINK ME
