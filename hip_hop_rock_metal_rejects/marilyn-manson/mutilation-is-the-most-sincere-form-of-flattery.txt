Hey
There's no rules today.
You steal instead of borrow.
You take all the shapes that I make.
And you think
That you thought
All the thoughts
That I thought you,
Don't you?
Mutilation's the most
Sincere form of flattery.
If you want to be me,
Then stand in line like the rest.
Now, do you know what I mean?
The young get less bolder
The legends get older
But I stay the same
As long as you have less to say
Do you think that I wouldn't say this?
You know that I play this better than you.
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
And
Fuck you too
Do you think that I wouldn't say this?
You know that I play this better than you.
Rebels without applause
I sell my shadow to those
Who are standing in it
They think I would
Bitch about them
Thinking they are
The shit
When they can't
Even step
In it
The young get less bolder
The legends get older
But I stay the same
As long as you have less to say
Do you think that I wouldn't say this?
You know that I play this better than you.
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
And
Fuck you too
The young get less bolder
The legends get older
But I stay the same
As long as you have less to say
Do you think that I wouldn't say this?
You know that I play this better than you.
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
And
Fuck you too
Do you think that I wouldn't say this?
You know that I play this better than you.
