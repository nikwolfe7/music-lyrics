Annie, told me,
Get out of here, head for the sea, 
The sun is hot and the air is clean 
The best things in the world are free 
And Mister Murphy
Likes his Jackanory 
Holsten Export times three
Jimi Hendrix and Thin Lizzy 
Annie, Annie, Annie 
 Met a mate in the afternoon 
Holsten shore-line pub-crawl 
Looking for some cold beer 
Missed the stone punch drunk Judy 
Tony, brandy, M.G., Andy 
Vodka, scotch and loads of beer 
It's so great we want to stay here 
Annie, Annie, Annie
