Drivel Head wears her glad rags, 
She's got her keys, money and fags, 
I know that her mind is made up, 
To get rocked. 
 Drivel Head needs a new man, 
As only a drivel head can, 
He's a hormonal nightmare, 
So beware. 
 Another victim of line up in line, 
Line up in line is all I remember. 
Oh, how their favours change, 
You could have been kinder.
Yes, yes, line up in line, 
Line up in line is all I remember. 
Oh, how their favours change, 
You could have been kinder. 
Drivel Head knows all the stars, 
Loves to suck their shining guitars, 
They've all been right up her stairs, 
Do you care? 
 Drivel Head knows all the bands, 
Knows them like the back of her hands. 
You can't see the wood for the trees, 
On your knees. 
 Another victim of line up in line, 
Line up in line is all I remember. 
Oh, how their favours change, 
You could have been kinder.
Yes, yes, line up in line, 
Line up in line is all I remember. 
Oh, how their favours change, 
You could have been kinder.
