You think you see me, in the glass
You think you hear me, you better listen fast,
I think I see you, gone to seed,
The only reasons, were your guilt and greed,
You're out there on your own,
Your face turned to stone,
Whatever happened to your life
Stone Dead Forever

It's been a long time, been a long long wait,
And you've caught your fingers, in the Pearly Gates,
You'd better leave your number, and we'll call you,
You know your problems, ain't exactly new,
The wrong side of the fold,
Your touch has turned to gold,
Whatever happened to your life
Stone Dead Forever

You're a financial wizard, a top tycoon,
A sweet lounge lizard, with a silver spoon,
You know you never had it, quite so good,
'Cos you didn't know, that you even could,
But the time has come to pay,
Turns out to have been a play,
Whatever happened to your life
Stone Dead Forever
