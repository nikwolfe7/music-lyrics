A grand oasis in the vastness of gloom
Child of dew-spangled cobweb, Mother to the Moon
Constellations beholders of the 3rd vagrant
Theater for the play of life

Tragedienne of heavens
Watching the eyes of the night
Sailing the virgin oceans
A Planetride for Mother and Child

Floating upon the quiet hydrogen lakes
In this ambrosial merrry-go-round they will gaze
Ephemeral life touched by a billion-year-show
Separating the poet from the woe

Repeat chorus

Oracle of the Delfian Domine
Witness of Adam's frailty
Seer of the master prophecy
The stellar world her betrothed

Wanderers in cosmic caravan
Universal bond - The Starborn

A son in search for the truth
Following the pages of Almagest
Discovering the origin of dreams
Stargazers ride through the ancient realms

Repeat chorus
