Down and out in London
Los Angeles and Paris, too, uh-huh
I drank a river in my time
To get on through, yeah

Well, the night, it rise above you, rise above me
And the blues, they swirl around me

To the heart of soul
You got to bleed a little while you sing
Lest the words don't mean nothing, no
Get to the heart of soul
Gotta get to the heart of soul, yeah

Get to the hip, now baby
'Fore the hip get to you, lil' woman
Try to bend me out of shape
Can't tell me, can't tell me what to do, little honey

Well, the night, it rise above me, rise above me, yeah
And those blues, they swirl around me, ooh, ooh

To the heart of soul
You gotta bleed a little while you sing
Lest the words don't mean nothing, no
Ow, get to the heart of soul, yeah
Gotta get to the heart of soul

You gotta bleed a little while your singing, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lest the words don't mean nothing, no
Get to the heart of soul, yeah
Baby, heart of soul, ow

From the delta
Down on the river
We need some heart of soul
In the world today now
A little bit of heart of soul now
In the world today
A little bit of soul now
A little heart of so-so-so-so, soul

You gotta bleed a little while your singing, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lest the words don't mean nothing, no they don't, no
Get to the heart of soul, yeah
