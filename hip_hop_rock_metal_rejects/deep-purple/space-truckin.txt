Well we had a lot of luck on Venus
We always had a ball on Mars
Meeting all the groovey people
We've rocked the Milky Way so far
We danced around with Borealice
We're space truckin' 'round the stars

Come on, come on, come on
Let's go space truckin'
Come on, come on, come on
Space truckin'

Remember when we did the moonshot
And Pony Trekker led the way
We'd move to the Canaveral moonstop
And every 'naut would dance and sway
We got music in our solar system
We're space truckin' 'round the stars

Come on, come on, come on
Let's go space truckin'
Come on, come on, come on
Space truckin'

The fireball that we rode was moving
But now we've got a new machine
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, the freak said
Man those cats can really swing
They got music in their solar system
They've rocked around the Milky Way
They danced around the Borealice
They're space truckin' everyday

Come on, come on, come on
Let's go space truckin'
Come on, come on, come on
Space truckin'

Come on, come on, come on
Let's go space truckin'
Come on, come on, come on
Space truckin'

Yeah yeah yeah space truckin'
Yeah yeah yeah space truckin'...
