Talking in her sleep again
Reciting lines start to end
But she's not crazy
Knock on wood
Just a little misunderstood

She takes a walk at 4AM
Wakes the neighborhood again
And I find myself recalling everything she used to tell me

Aw yeah, alright, truth hurts inside
Aw yeah, that's right, you go around once in life

Everybody wants to be a part
Everybody loves a situation
Who would ever want to play the part
Of anonymous numbers on a governmental chart

She's waiting tables the next day
She pulls a double then on her way 
To an audition in Hollywood, yeah,
A little misunderstood

We sit around the house
Waiting for the phone to ring
And I know she alone holds the key 
To everything I want to be

Aw yeah, alright, truth hurts inside
Aw yeah, that's right, you go around once in life

Everybody wants to be a part
Everybody loves a situation
Who would ever want to play the part
Of anonymous numbers on a governmental chart

Everybody wants to be your friend 
When you've got something you can give them
All I've seen, bad and good, she's not crazy
Just a little misunderstood.

Aw yeah, all good, she's not crazy,
Just a little misunderstood.

Two years later you're a star
Who'd have thought we'd get this far
But I'd give it all away if I
Could see you on that day again
When you quit work
And threw that coffee
At the manager jerk

You said, "Close your eyes
I've got a surprise
A house in the hills
And a car that drives by."

Aw yeah, alright, truth hurts, don't it Inside 
Aw yeah, that's right, you go around once in life

Everybody wants to be a part
Everybody loves a situation
Who would ever want to play the part
Of anonymous numbers on a governmental chart

Everybody wants to be your friend
When you've got something you can give them
All I've seen, bad and good, she's not crazy
Just a little misunderstood.

Aw yeah, all good, she's not crazy,
Just a little misunderstood.
