I sit and watch your flowers wilting in the kitchen
I felt like I was one of them gasping for air.
I go from room to room hoping to find your 
I play my music louder than you'd like me to 

Why can't I be your lover
Can there be another
And when I feel without I want to get you in.
Can't I be your lover
At five o'clock you come shuffling in.
And when I lock you out I want to get you,
Get you, get you in.

I understand that you are going through a hard time
But what you need to recognize I'm in one too
You say that maybe we should take some time apart
But you go your way, I'll get by, and you'll go get high
You just see if I mind.

Why can't I be your lover
Can there be another
And when I feel without I want to get you in.
Why can't I be your lover
At five o'clock you come shuffling in.
And when I lock you out I want to get you,
Let you, get you in.

Well I could be wrong I don't even know myself
And I must be strong when you're gone so long
I don't need to know reasons why.

What I wouldn't do for you.

Why can't I be your lover
Can there be another
And when I feel without I want to get you in.
Why can't I be your lover
At five o'clock you come shuffling in.
And when I lock you out I want to get you,
Let you, get you in.
I want to get you in.
