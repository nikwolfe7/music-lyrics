I can still recall
The way you looked that fall
In your favorite dress
The day before you left
And since that time
I wrote a simple rhyme

And I miss you and the things you do
The time we had, the good and bad
The day we met that I can't forget
Signed Sincerely, Me

Are you cross at your loss
But could you be more obsessive
If I'd given you the chance
But since you asked, a reply but it's the last

And I miss you and the things you do
The love you fake, the heart you break.
The buzz you caught, and the times we fought
Signed Sincerely, Me.
Oh, my God, and don't forget P.S.
I moved away to a new address
It's far away and I think it's best
Signed Sincerely, Me.

Why can't it be like it was
The rain falls, the summer ends.
Why can't it be like it was
You always said you'd never go away.

And I confess, I was such a mess
I drove for fifteen hours
On this nasty Greyhound bus
Yes, I've returned.
You'd think that I would have learned.

But I miss you and the things you do
The times we had, the good and bad
The day we met that I can't forget
Signed Sincerely, Me

Could you really be a bitch like that
Broke my door when you stole the cat.
Someone said that you even laughed
Signed Sincerely, Me

Why can't it be like it was
The rain falls, the summer ends.
Why can't it be like it was
You always said you'd never go away.

And I miss you...

The hope you give.
The life you live.
The cross you bear.
The way you swear.
The face you make
When you masturbate.
Our bed in the moonlight.
And the night we fought
You were so distraught.
And the lies I denied
Even when you cried,
God knows I apologize,
Signed Sincerely, Me.

Why can't it be like it was
The rain goes, the sun returns.
Why can't it be like it was
You always said you'd never go away.
You'd never go away.
You'd never go away.

Signed Sincerely, Me.
