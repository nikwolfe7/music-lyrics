Sally You opened out your arms
To all those young men
And girl you had room
For every one of them 
You're the only girl
on bowery and third
Sure as hell you're the one
who cared 

So put your hands together for sally
She saved all those young men
Put your hands together for sally
She's the one who cared for them 

She's doing our dirty work
She's the only one who cares
Doing our dirty work
Thirsty world one angry day, in new york 

Take a look at dave he was once seventeen
Zoot suit and shinny shoes
He ran around town
and through his methylated laughter
Most of his memories drowned
But he remembers what his mommy use to shout
She used to shout
One day surely son
The streets are gonna tire you out 

So put your hands together for sally
She's the one who cared for him
Put your hands together for sally
She was there when his luck was running thin

She's doing our dirty work
She's the only one who cares
Doing our dirty work
Thirsty world, one angry day, in new york 

Tommy had a wife and family
But the needle came between the love and the hard times
Thank God for sally
She was there through the misery
Just a place to lay his head
Just about better off than dead 

She's doing our dirty work
She's the only one who cares
Doing our dirty work
Thirsty world, one angry dame 

Vince came up from the country
Couldn't even find himself a room
Thinking about his babies
That's further away than the moon 

With no money but his pride in his pocket
There's really no way he can go home
There's a picture of his woman in his locket
Most of all he doesn't want to be alone 

So put your hands together for sally
She's the one who cared for him
Put your hands together for sally
She was there when his luck was running thin 

She's doing our dirty work
She's the only one who cares
Doing our dirty work
Thirsty world, one angry day, in new york
