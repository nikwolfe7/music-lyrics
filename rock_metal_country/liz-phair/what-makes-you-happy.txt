But don't worry, mom, I met him in a restaurant
And all this time I've been getting to know him
He's got an ex-wife in Pasadena
And sometimes she's a mess to deal with
But mostly we've been living here uninjured
There's a silence, and she says:
";Listen here young lady
All that matter is what makes you happy
But you leave this house knowing my opinion
won't make you love me if you don't care to.";
But mom, I'm sending you this photograph,
I swear this one is going to last
And all those other bastards were only practice
I feel the sun on my back
I smell the earth in my skin
I see the sky above me like a full recovery
";Listen here young lady
All that matters is what makes you happy
But you leave this house knowing my opinion
Won't make you love me if you don't care."; 
";Listen here young lady
All that matters is what makes you happy
But you leave this house knowing my opinion
Won't make a difference if you're not ready
";Listen here young lady
All that matters is what makes you happy
But you leave this house knowing my opinion
Won't make you love me if you don't care."; 
";Listen here young lady
All that matters is what makes you happy
But you leave this house knowing my opinion
Won't make you love me if you don't care.";
Make you love me if you don't care
