Baby got goin' on a southern train, you know
Fired up pistons drivin' below
And the whole vibration, seat upholstery
Silky underwear, oh conductor let's roll
Let's roll!
Baby got goin' but I can't complain, you know
It knocks me out when she acts so strange,
It's like a Big Mac truck cut across two lanes in my soul
Conductor, let's throw some metal down, roll!
Let's roll!
Baby got goin' when the train kept a rollin'
Baby got goin' when the train kept a rollin'
Baby got goin' when the train kept a rollin'
Baby got goin' when the train kept a rollin'
Squeeze her knees underneath a book, you know
A real good shakin' is all it took
Cause my baby's hooked on me
And as you can see I'm wild about her!
She got goin' but I can't complain, you know
It knocks me out when she acts so strange
It's like a Big Mac truck cut across two lanes in my soul
Conductor let's throw some metal down, roll! Let's roll!
She gets mad when it goes too slow,
So I'm beggin' you man keep a-shovelin' that coal and let's roll!
Let's roll
Roll
Roll
Roll
Roll
Roll
