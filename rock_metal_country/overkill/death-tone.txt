MANOWAR R. Friedman/ J. DeMaio
Ridin' on to wheels
Chainsuit on my heels
Sittin' on leather
Ridin' on steel
Put my shades on
Hair blows in the wind
I give some square the finger
Now he won't look again, no he won't
PreChorus:
Now, you were sittin'
And I got sent to Nam
I give some square the finger
You just worked at job
Chorus:
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me ride
On into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight
My social workers
Got me on a chain
Keeps me out of jail
So the paper prints his name, yes it does, and he likes it
Unemployment checks
Run out next week
It won't be very long
'Til I'm back on the streets again
PreChorus:
Now, you were sittin' home
And I was sent to Nam
I wen't through the big house
You just worked at job
Chorus:
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me ride
On into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight
Death tone
Death tone
Gonna ride on my death tone
On into the night
