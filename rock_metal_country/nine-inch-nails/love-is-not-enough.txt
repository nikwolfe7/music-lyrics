The more that we take
The paler we get
I can't remember what it is
We try to forget
The tile on the floor
So cold it can sting
In your eyes is a place
Worth remembering

For you to go and take this, to smash it apart
I've gone all this fucking way
To wind up back at
Back at the start

[Chorus:]
Hey, the closer we think we are
Well it only got us so far
Now you got anything left to show
No no I didn't think so
Hey, the sooner we realize
We cover ourselves with lies
But underneath we're not so tough
And love is not enough

Well it hides in the dark
Like the withering vein
We didn't give it a mouth
So it cannot complain
It never really had a chance
We'd never really make it through
I never think I'd believed
I believed I could get better with you

[Chorus]
