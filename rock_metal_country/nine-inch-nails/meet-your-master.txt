Bow down in position
Against the polished steel
This is something different
You'll like the way this feels
No time for asking questions
No time for wondering
We've had enough of you now
You've heard everything

You want to play a new game
You put on this blindfold
You do what we tell you
You do as you're told
Used to be the leader
Now comes the time to serve
Maybe we'll show some mercy
Maybe you'll get what you deserve

Countdown to the end, but make it go faster
This is your disaster
Countdown to the end, but make it go faster
Come on down, my friend
It's time to meet your master

You've left quite a mess here under your stewardship
You thought you figured it out but you'll find your place in this
You think its so convincing, you think you see the truth
Give us so many things, now who's got time for you

Countdown to the end, but make it go faster
This is your disaster
Countdown to the end, but make it go faster
Come on down, my friend
It's time to meet your master

Come on down
