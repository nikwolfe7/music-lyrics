[Bryan:]
Well I can't control the universe
Cause I'm only a man
And I've been reading the papers
But they won't tell me who I am

[Shane:]
If you really need a new philosophy
Well there's one that makes sense
The one I profess but I say

[Chorus: All]
Hey whatever
Let your beauty come alive
Let your colour fill the sky
And say whatever
Why don't you liberate your mind
Let your colour fill the sky

[Shane:]
All the world's a waiting room
And we're standing in line
For the answers to the question
"What makes this fine?"

[Mark:]
Don't let them change your story
Won't let them change your song
Don't let the gurus and philosophers lead you on
Ahh...

[Chorus]

[Mark:]
Wooo!
It's like taking a seat at the roulette table
Just spinning the wheel
Good or bad just take what comes
Don't change how you feel
Youre a champion of science
Or are y'just some freak show's fool
What can not be proved, no no
Can still be true
And I say
[Chorus]

Ahhh...
Heeey whatever
