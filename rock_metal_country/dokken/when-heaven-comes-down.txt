Lyrics: Pilson, Brown, Lynch
     Total confusion- one final sin
     Someone's religion and greed
     Accidents happen, someone to blame
     Who's got the answers we need?

     I don't know who to believe
     But I know who's gonna set me free
     Cause I'll be waiting

     When heaven comes down

     Ashes to ashes, sorrow and shame
     Look at the future again
     Angels in heaven walking the streets
     Searching for someone to blame

     I don't know who to believe
     But I know who's gonna set me free
     Cause I'll be waiting

     When heaven comes down
     Until tomorrow
     When heaven comes down


     Cause I'll be waiting
     When heaven comes down
     Until tomorrow
     When heaven comes down
