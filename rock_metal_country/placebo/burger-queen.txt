Slightly bemused by his lack of direction
Hey You, Hey You
Came to this world by caesarean section
Hey You, Hey You
Chooses his clothes to match his pallid complexion
Hey You, Hey You
Now it takes him all day just to get an erection

Hey You, 
Things aren't what they seem.
Makes no sense at all
Things aren't what they seem.
Makes no sense at all

Goes out to cruise and to meet his connection
Hey You, Hey You
He never scores he just gets an infection
Hey You, Hey You
Dreams of a place with a better selection
Hey You, Hey You
Still it takes him all day just to get an erection
Hey You, 

Things aren't what they seem
Makes no sense at all,
Things aren't what they seem
Makes no sense at all,
Things aren't what they seem
Makes no sense at all,
Things aren't what they seem
Makes no sense at all,
Luxemburger Queen,
He's a Burger Queen.

Slightly bemused by the total rejection,
Hey You, Hey You,
Came to this world by caesarean section,
Hey You, Hey You,
Dreams of a place with a better selection,
Hey You, Hey You,
Dreams of a face that is pure as perfection,
Hey you,

Things aren't what they seem,
Luxemburger Queen,
Luxemburger Queen,
Luxemburger Queen,
He's a Burger Queen
