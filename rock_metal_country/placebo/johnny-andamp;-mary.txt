Johnny's always running around, trying to find certainty.
He needs all the world to confirm, that he aint lonely

Mary counts walls, knows he tires easily

Johnny thinks the world would be right, if it would buy, truth from him.
Mary says he changes his mind, more than a woman.

But she made her bed, even when the chance was slim.

Johnny says he's willing to learn, when he decides, he's a fool.
Johnny say's he'll live any where, when he earns time to.

Mary combs her hair, says she should be use to it.

Mary always edges her bets, she never knows, what to think.
She says that he still acts, like he's being discovered.

Scared that he'll get caught, without a second thought

Johnny feels he's wasting his breath, trying to talk, sense to her
Mary says he's lacking a real, sense of proportion
So she combs her hair, knows he tires easily

Johnny's always running around, trying to find certainty.
He needs all the world to confirm, that he aint lonely

Mary counts walls, says she should be use to it.
