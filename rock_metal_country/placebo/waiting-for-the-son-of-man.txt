Patience comes to the ugly, not me
laughter comes to the lucky, not me
people in my head that won't stop talking
nothing in my dream that isn't creepy crawling

waiting
waiting
for the son of man
for the son of man

you guessed it
only lifeguards
only lifeguards
packing all the time
can save me

waiting
waiting
waiting
for the son of man
for the son of man
