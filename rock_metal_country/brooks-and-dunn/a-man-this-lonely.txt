A man this lonely 
A man this blue 
A man whose world's been torn in two 
Needs somebody 
With a heart that's true 
A man this lonely needs a woman like you 

Two arms this empty 
Need someone to hold 
A man this lost needs somewhere to go 
When the nights go on forever 
And the days do too 
A man this lonely needs a woman like you 

I'd lost hope 
I was so far down 
Here you come turning all that around 
I'd come to think 
Of love as a lie 
All that's on my mind now 
Is you by my side 

A man this lonely 
A man this blue 
A man whose world's been torn in two 
Needs somebody 
With a heart that's true 
A man this lonely needs a woman like you 
A man this lonely needs a woman like you
