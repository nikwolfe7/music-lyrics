[Chorus]
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do do

I was riding on the e-train
I was whistling to the rhythm
I was thinking about my live-in
I was feeling pretty fine
I asked the time
Got a poke in the eye

When I read the latest news
How we can't believe he wore those shoes
Should we have the man impeached
Or should we shoot him in the foot
Well you waste my time
You waste my time
Looking for two hundred ways to hang a guy

[Chorus]

Allegations
Interrogations
Investigations
Then more taxation
National past time is aggrivation
I think I'll move out to a desert isle
Just for a while

To avoid all that's distracting
Like newspapers and magazines
Insipid propagandizing
To tell me what a loser I've elected
But you've neglected to tell the truth
That your politics is tied around his foot
And we too are dangling

[Chorus Twice]

Do you think that we are crazy
Low I.Q., that we are lazy
That we sit here watching sitcoms
That we have no clue to what is going on
Well you got that wrong

Wait and see, the boom will fall
The morning eggs will hit the wall
And everyone I know will call
To say that change is hanging in the air
You'd best beware
You'll wake up and average Joe is in your chair
Just because he'd kinda like to do what's right
But more cause all you politicians do is fight

[Chorus Twice]
