Uh-huh, huh, huh, huh
Let me hear ya now
Uh, huh

When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you
Stand out in a crowd

Someone picked you from that bunch
One glance was all it took
But now it's much too late for me
To take a second look

Oh, baby, give me one more chance
Show you that I love you
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart?

Oh, baby, I was blind to let you go
Let you go, baby
But now since I see you
In her arms

I want you back
Yes, I do now
I want you back
Ooh, ooh, baby

I want you back
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I want you back
Na, na, na, na

Tryin' to live without your love
Is one long sleepless night
Let me show you, boy
That I know wrong from right

Every street you walk on
I leave tear stains on the ground
Following you, boy
I didn't even want around

Let me tell you now
Oh, baby, all I need is one more chance
Show you that I love you
Oh, won't you please let me
Back in your heart?

Oh, darling, I was blind to let you go
Let you go, baby
But now since I see you
In her arms, arms

A-buh-buh-buh-buh
A-buh-buh-buh-buh
All I want
A-buh-buh-buh-buh

All I need
A-buh-buh-buh-buh
All I want
A-buh-buh-buh-buh
All I need

All I need is just one more chance
To show you that I love you, baby
Baby
Baby
Baby
Baby

I want you back
Forget what happened then
I want you back
Let me live again

Oh, baby, I was blind to let you go
'Cause now since I see you
In her arms

I want you back
Spare me of this cause
I want you back
Give back what I lost

Oh, baby, I need one more chance
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart?
I want you back

Forget what happened then
I want you back
Let me live again
Oh, baby
