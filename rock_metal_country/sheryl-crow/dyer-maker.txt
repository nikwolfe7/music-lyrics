      Oh oh oh oh oh 
      You don't have to go oh oh oh oh 
      You don't have to go oh oh oh oh 
      You don't have to go 

      Ay ay ay ay ay 
      All those tears I cry ay ay ay ay 
      Ooh those tears I cry ay ay 
      Baby please don't go 

      When I read the letter you wrote me 
      It made me mad mad mad 
      When I read the words that it told me 
      It made me sad sad sad 
      I still love you so 
      I can't let you go 
      I love you - ooh baby I love you 

      Oh oh oh oh oh 
      Every breath I take oh oh oh oh 
      Every move I make oh oh 
      Baby please don't go Ay ay ay ay ay 
      It hurts me to my soul oh oh 
      It hurts me to my soul oh oh 
      Baby please don't go 

      When I read the letter you sent me 
      You made me mad mad mad 
      When I read the news that it told me 
      It made me sad sad sad 
      I still love you so 
      I can't let you go 
      I love you - ooh baby I love you 

      Oh you hurt me so 
      That's a big no no 
      You shouldn't hurt me 

      Oh oh oh oh oh 
      You don't have to go oh oh oh oh 
      You don't have to oh oh oh oh 
      Baby...
