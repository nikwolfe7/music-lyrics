folded in your fleshy purse 
i am floating once again 
while the muted sounds are pumping rhythm 
all the walls close in on me 
pressure's building wave on wave 
'til the water breaks - and outside i go, oh 

one dot, that's on or off, defines what is and what is not, one dot 
two dot, a pair of eyes, a voice, a touch, complete surprise, two dot 

growing up, growing up, 
looking for a place to live 
growing up, growing up 
looking for a place to live 
growing up, growing up, 
looking for a place to live 

my ghost likes to travel so far in the unknown 
my ghost likes to travel so deep into your space 

three dot, a trinity, a way to map the universe, 
three dot 
four dot, is what will make a square, a bed to build on, it's all there, 
four dot 

my ghost likes to travel so far in the unknown 
my ghost likes to travel so deep into your space 

all the slow clouds pass us by 
make the Empire State look high 
as you take me in your sea-stained sweetness 
it spills, it tingles and it stings 
all the pleasure that it brings 
'til the door has let the outside inside here 

well on the floor there's a long wooden table 
on the table there's an open book 
on the page there's a detailed drawing 
and on the drawing is the name i took 

my ghost likes to travel so far in the unknown 
my ghost likes to travel so deep into your space 

growing up, growing up, 
looking for a place to live 
growing up, growing up 
looking for a place to live 
growing up, growing up, 
looking for a place to live 
growing up, growing up, 
looking for a place to live 

my ghost likes to travel 
my ghost likes to travel 
moving inside of your space 
my ghost likes to travel 
my ghost likes to travel 
moving inside of your space 
my ghost likes to travel 
moving inside 
my ghost likes to travel 
moving inside of your space 
my ghost likes to travel 
moving inside 
my ghost likes to travel 
moving inside of your space 

the breathing stops, i don't know when 
in transition once again 
such a struggle getting through these changes 
and it all seems so absurd 
to be flying like a bird 
when i do not feel I've really landed here
