i woke up and the world outside was dark 
all so quiet before the dawn 
opened up the door and walked outside 
the ground was cold 

i walked until i couldn't walk anymore 
to a place i'd never been 
there was something stirring in the air 
in front of me, i could see 

more than this 
more than this 
so much more than this 
there is something else there 
when all that you had has all gone 
and more than this 
i stand 
feeling so connected 
and i'm all there 
right next to you 

it started when i saw the ship go down 
i saw them struggle in the sea 
and suddenly the picture disappears 
in front of me 

now we're busy making all our busy plans 
on foundations built to last 
but nothing fades as fast as the future 
and nothing clings like the past, until we can see 

more than this 
more than this 
so much more than this 
there is something out there 
more than this 
it's coming through 
and more than this 
i stand alone and so connected 
and I'm all there 
right next to you 

oh then it's alright 
when with every day another bit falls away 
oh but it's still alright, alright, alright 
and like words together we can make some sense 

much more than this 
way beyond imagination 
much more than this 
beyond the stars 
with my head so full 
so full of fractured pictures 
and i'm all there 
right next to you 
so much more than this 
there is something else there 
when all that you had has all gone 
and more than this 
i'm alone 
feeling so connected 
and i'm all there right next to you 

more than this 
more than this 
more than this
