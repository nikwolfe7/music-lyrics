Nothin' on Earth that'll get me hummin'
Like a heat wave comin' and I'll come runnin'
With her makin' that tan in the broad daylight
And every night is a Saturday night
And everything's right with the summer comin'
I'm the first one standin' in line
For my day in the sun I've been workin' 'til the sun don't shine
Takin' off my hat leave it to the boys
Get that old work monkey down off my back
All I want's a little peace and noise
Hit the cruise control get me back on track
Let my old Ford treat me like a Cadillac
Repeat Chorus
When the day gets cookin' gonna grab my toys
And it really doesn't matter which wave we're on
Get to turnin' up them good old boys
Crankin' into the night, by the break of dawn
All the towns are red and I still see blonde
Repeat Chorus
For my day in the sun I've been workin'
'Til the sun don't shine
For my day in the sun I've been workin'
'Til the sun don't shine
Summer's comin' to shine
Summer's comin' to shine
Summer's comin'
