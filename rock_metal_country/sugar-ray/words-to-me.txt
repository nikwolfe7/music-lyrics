Get up!
Get up!
Get up!
Yeah
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!

She sings these words to me
She sings these words to me
I look at you and try to do
the best I can
but sometimes
it ain't that easy
If not today, she said, then tell me when
I think I tried to say I'm sorry
Then she said these words of reverence
Please don't leave me hanging on and on
I see the light in your window
Look at the sky and we can go
Away

[Chorus]
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!And I'm gonna
Pick you up and take you where I wanna
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!And I'm gonna
Pick you up and take you where I wanna

La, la, la, la, la, la
She sings these words to me
She sings these words to me
Baby
The summer's sun is warm
and you, are everywhere
But sometimes
it ain't that easy
I count the days till I see you again
You know I tried and I am sorry
One night can make a difference
Please don't leave me hanging on and on
I see the light in your window
Look at the sky and we can go
Away

[Chorus]
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!And I'm gonna
Pick you up and take you where I wanna
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!And I'm gonna
Pick you up and take you where I wanna

La, la, la, la, la, la
She sings these words to me
She sings these words to me
Baby
And I don't mind the waiting
When she sings these words to me
I see the light in your window
Look at the sky and we can go
Look at the sky and we can go
Away
She says these words
She says these words
La, la, la, la, la, la
She says these words
Come away with me tonight
She says these words
La, la, la, la, la, la
She says these words
Come away with me tonight

Get up!
Get up!
Get up!And I'm gonna
Pick you up and take you where I wanna
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!
Yeah
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!And I'm gonna
Pick you up and take you where I wanna
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!

And I don't mind the waiting
when she sings these words to me
La, la, la, la, la, la
Come away with me tonight
La, la, la, la, la, la
