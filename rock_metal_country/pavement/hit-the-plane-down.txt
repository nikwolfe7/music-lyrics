I'm up on a hill top where I
Keep you in sight, my little toys
I buried you because the sun
Will melt them
Got you up my  sleeve
Got you up my  sleeve
Got you up my  sleeve
Got you up my  sleeve
Got you up my  sleeve
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
Taking over
Taking over your life
I'm taking over your scene
Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya
I would hope see the face I would hope you see her face
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down taking over
There's no survivors
There's no survivors
Don't even snow we're not that disturbed
Don't even snow
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down taking over
There's no survivors
There's no survivors
Taking over your life
Taking over your life
I'm taking over the scene
I'm taking everything
All I wanted it all
My little trick
I wouldn't mind just a milligram up my sleeve
I've got you up my sleeve
I've Got you up my sleeve
I've got you up my sleeve
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
There's no survivors
Taking over your life
Taking over your life
I'm taking over the scene
I'm taking everything
I'm taking everything
I've got to melt it     X 10
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down theres no survivors
There is no survivors
