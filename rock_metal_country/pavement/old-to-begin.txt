Embrace the senile genius
Watch him reinvent the wheel
I don't need your summary acts, summary acts to give into the narrative
age
Old to begin -- I will set you back, set you back, set you
Old to begin -- I will set you back, set you back, set you
We get to feeling like a fixture
Set in 1966 -- time came that we drifted apart
Drifted apart to find an identical twin
Old to begin -- I will set you back, set you back, set you
Old to begin -- I will set you back, set you back, fella
Searching for latent cause -- blame it on menopause
Or perhaps stress and strain -- credit cards, lumbar pain
But I've seen your double dares everything extraordinaire
I know the things you do are gonna come back
