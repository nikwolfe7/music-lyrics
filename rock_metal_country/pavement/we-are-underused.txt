Out beyond the call of duty --
hold your instincts hostage and stick near me
Let's drink a toast -- it's the most I can stand to cry about
The mental energy you wasted on this wedding invitation
Let's thank the host -- you've been such a perfect host
The roast was just so perfectly prepared
Now I know you care -- now I know you care
We are underused
We are underused
Simply put, I want to grow old -- dying does not meet my expectations
Let's drink a toast to all those who arrived alive to tell
About their struggles in hushed tones around a fire
It's late winter -- let's sink the ship, mix our blood, just the tip
A crip is sleeping on the basement stairs
Oh, I know he's there -- oh, I know he's there
We are underused
We are underused, yeah
We are underused.
We are underused.
We are underused.
We are underused.
We are under, under, under, under, underused!
We are underused.
We are under, under, under, under, underused!
We are underused.
