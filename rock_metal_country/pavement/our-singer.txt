i've been waitin'
anticipatin'
sun comes up
the skies won't sink my soul
i've dreamt of this
but is never comes
but it never comes
the risin'
the natures dry
folk!
i've been dreamin'
traced out but dreamin'
the sun coems up
the blisters burn my soul
i'm dreamin
of something now
of something now
of the risin'
the natures dry
and all the groovey ones ?
