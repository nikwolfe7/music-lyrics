i was dressed for success
but success it never comes
and i'm the only one who laughs
at your jokes when they are so bad
and your jokes are always bad
but they're not as bad as this
come join us in a prayer
we'll be waiting waiting where
everything's ending here
and all the sterile striking it defends
an empty dock you cast away
and rain upon your forehead
where the mist's for hire if it's just too clear
let's spend our last quarterstance randomly
go down to the outlet once again
painted portraits of minions & slaves
crotch mavens and one night plays
are they the only ones who laugh?
at the jokes when they are so bad
and the jokes they're always bad
but they're not as bad as this
come join us in a prayer
we'll be waiting waiting where
everything's ending here
and all the spanish candles unsold
away have gone to this
and a ";run-on piece of mount on";
trembles, shivers, runs down the freeway
i guess she spent her last quarter randomly
i guess a guess is the best i'll do
last time last time
was the best time
