rotten device, i'll say it twice
i'm too much i'm too much comforted here
costs too much too much, we'll leave you
everywhere eyes, nowhere to die
no place to shove your sharpened heel
i'm looking looking for a tired face
in case you wanted to go
i know, i'm breathing in to the end
calling the bluffs, talking so tough
goodbye to the ugly steeple fear
good times for ever after
i'm just a man 
you see who i am
i'm binding my hooks
and open the books
dirty black hearts
angel of corpus cristi
you're so misty, tell me what i want to hear
i know i'm reeling in...[x2] 
to the end [x4]
i know i'll never know [x2]
