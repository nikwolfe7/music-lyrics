your western homes are locked forever
the new frontier is not that near
magnetic screens that fold in backward
will only bring you years of fear
this is what i always wanted,
a new home with a place to breathe
bring your congregation someday
and you will never...
never see what i want
i can't see what i want
can't see what i want
i can't see what i want
what i want
can't see
