You say you love me 
Why do you always do me down down down? 
I hit rock bottom 
You gave me up without sound, sound, sound 
But now I'm back in town and feeling mighty fit 
I'm sick and tired of eating all your chicken shit 
So keep on looking for me 
Once I was lost but now I'm found, found, found 
I was a rising star 
You hitched your wagon next to mine, mine, mine 
The sun was shining bright 
I guess I never read the sign, sign, sign 
Right at the moment that you saw my hand first slip 
Just like a dirty rat you jumped the sinking ship 
So keep on looking for me 
Once I was lost but now I'm found, found, found 

Find me in the palace 
Find me on the street 
Find me back in church 
Right in my favourite seat 
Now you're a notch on my gun 
Who are you to shoot off your mouth? 

Wild-eyed and crazy 
I always threw my cash around, round, round 
You put the boot in 
Until the bottom fell right out, out, out 
I turned around 
You smell like Monday morning's fish 
I can't get near enough to take a goodbye kiss 
So keep on looking for me 
Once I was lost but now I'm found, found, found 

Find me in the movies 
Right on the TV screen 
Keep on searching for me 
And you will hear me scream 
Now you're a notch on my gun 
Now you're a notch on my gun 
Who are you to shoot off your mouth? 
Shoot off your mouth 

But now I'm back in town and feeling mighty fit 
I'm sick and tired of eating all your chicken shit 
So keep on looking for me 
Once I was lost but now I'm found, found, found 

Find me in the palace 
Find me on the street 
Find me back in church 
Right in my favourite seat 
Now you're a notch on my gun 
Who are you to shoot off your mouth? 
Shoot off your mouth 
Shoot off your mouth 
Shoot off your 
Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot 
Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot
