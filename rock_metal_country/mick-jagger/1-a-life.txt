We got half a life, we got half a dream 
We got half a love, we got half a scheme 
Always sitting in the darkness, I'll wait for you 
Nervous of the neighbors, I'd like a hotel room 
Cause I'm indiscreet, can't keep quiet 
Heaven I don't know how 
I can't go on seeing you like this 
Give that knife just one more twist 
This affair is really going to break my heart 

Living half a life is better than nothing, half a dream 
You know I can't keep quiet 'cause I'm indiscreet 
I guess half a loaf leaves me feeling hungry 
Half a glass, half a dream, half a life 
Heaven I don't know how! 
I can't go on seeing you like this 
Give that knife just one more little twist 
This affair is really going to break my heart 

Let's call our friends! Let's go hang out! Let's go out dancing! 
Let's jump and shout! Let's go be seen! Let's dress up chic! 
Show we're in love! Right on our street! 
Let's go out trashy! Let's go act cheap! 
What does it matter what other people think? 
Step in the bright lights! 
Let's go act wild! 
I want to show that you're mine all mine 

Here's to freezing in the doorways, here's to taking separate taxis 
To our stolen conversations, we're never seen together 
Half a dream, half a life, heaven I don't know how! 
But I can't go on seeing you like this! 
Give that knife just one more little twist 
This affair is really going to break my heart 

I can't go on seeing you like this! 
I can't go on seeing you like this! 
I can't go on seeing you like this! 
I can't go on seeing you like this! 
Give that knife just one more little twist 
I can't go on seeing you like this! 
I can't go on seeing you like this! 
Give that knife just one more little twist...
