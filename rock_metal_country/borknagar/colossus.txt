From out of static time has grown
Existence formed by substance unknown
Prelude to matter, shift of disorder
Completion of bonds between chaos and order 

The era of seasons, the essence of being
The continuous process awakens the living
Absorber of every flickering sun
Arranging the pieces to vivid perfection 

The stream of mortality flows uncontrolled
A boundless downward spiral to prospective void
Existence takes its toll, extinction unfolds
The Colossus falls back from its treshold 

The cosmic grip so tight. Heed the celestial call
The rise, the voyage, the fall- tangled womb of mortal soil 

Universal key of inception, pulled out of the grind
The growing seed of creation and time 

Complex fusion, the bond of four- the nature's core
Universal ritual, aesthetic beauty adored 

The pendulum upholds the carnal deceit
Eternal, endless, indefinite 

The paradox, render and the merge is complete
Nothing but the process is infinite 

Nothing but the process is infinite
Eternal, endless, indefinite
