got this feeling when i heard your name the other day   
couldn't say it, couldn't make it go away   
it's a hard place, can't be friends, we can't be enemies   
it's just too much, feel the weight crushing down on my face   

the hardest part is things already said   
getting better, worse, i can not tell   
why do good things never wanna stay?   
some things you lose, some things you give away   

broken pieces, try to make it good again   
is it worth it, will it make me sick today   
it's a dumb song, but i'll write it anyway   
it's an old mistake, but we always make it, why do we   

the hardest part is things already said   
getting better, worse, i can not tell   
why do good things never wanna stay?   
some things you lose, some things you give away   

this time, it'll be alright   
this time, it'll be okay   
this time, it'll be alright   
this time, it'll be okay   

the hardest part is things already said   
getting better, worse, i can not tell   
why do good things never wanna stay?   
some things you lose, some things you give away  
some things you lose, some things you give away
