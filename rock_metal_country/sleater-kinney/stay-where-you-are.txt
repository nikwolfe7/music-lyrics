i can't find you   
stay where you are   
i'm in the dark   
stay where you are   

i'm alright   
i feel fine   
you're my life   
i'm alright   

she's dead if you want and that's me if you want   
stuffed in the corner, ";little girl lost";   
and i claw and i scratch and i beg and i scream   
i just need you to save me one last time   
it's me if you want but it's not what i want   
i want to burn up the place   
set it on fire   
she's bad because she wants to not be contained   
i can't tell the truth, i can't speak this way   

you can't find me   
you're in the dark   
i'm right here   
stay where you are   

i'm alright   
i feel fine   
you're my life   
i'm alright   she's dead if you want and that's me if you want   
stuffed in the corner, ";little girl lost";   
and i claw and i scratch and i beg and i scream   
i just need you to save me one last time   
it's me if you want but it's not what i want   
i want to burn up the place   
set it on fire   
she's bad because she wants to set things on fire   
i can't tell the truth, i can't speak this way   

stay where, where, where you are   
i'm where, where, where you are   

i'm alright   
i feel fine   
you're my life   
i'm alright   

she's dead if you want and that's me if you want   
stuffed in the corner, ";little girl lost";   
i claw and i scratch and i beg and i scream   
i just need you to save me this time   
it's me if you want but it's not what i want   
i want to burn it up   
set it on fire   
she's bad because she wants to not be contained   
i can't tell the truth, i won't speak your way
