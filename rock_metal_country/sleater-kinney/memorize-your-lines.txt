I've learned how to wait, I know not to beg. 
I know I shouldn't ask why I wake up feeling dead. 
Say forever, that's a dirty word 
Will you stay here, that's a dirty girl 
Perform of my life, performance of your life. 
Act two, scene four, line three 
I want this room, just for me, just for me 

You said you'd never be mine, you swore it to me until the end of time. 
You said that love's never kind, 
I memorize these lines, practice them every night. 

We can talk it out, tell each other lies. 
We can just pretend today isn't goodbye. 
It will be soon, now 
heard that before 
You better polish your speech 
before you hit the floor... 

Won't you tell me what are we fighting for? 
Do you want me here do you know for sure? 
You know the coldest face is the worst to me 
and I won't calm down 'till I get to you 

You know that I wish I could undo this role 
Let's go back to what, what we came here for
