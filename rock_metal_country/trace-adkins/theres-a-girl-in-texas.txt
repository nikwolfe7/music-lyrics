Trace Adkins/Vip Vipperman
When I rode out of Dallas
Chasing down a dream
I thought I knew what I was looking for
But the neon nights have blinded me
'Til I'm lost in Tennessee
Not sure I know who I am anymore... but

There's a girl in Texas
There's a girl in Texas
There's a girl in Texas
That does

You're a truly lovely lady
And you sure light up the night
I'm a lonely man but I'm leaving here alone
I won't try to lie to you
About this heart of mine
That I can't give, that I don't really own... cause

There's a girl in Texas
There's a girl in Texas
There's a girl in Texas
That doesIf this dream that I've been chasing
Ever sets me free
And I wake up to find it don't need me

There's a girl in Texas
There's a girl in Texas
There's a girl in Texas
That does

Yes, there's a girl in Texas that I still love
