Hello it's us again
We're still so in love with you 
And yes we mean it too 
Yes we're so in love with you 

Hello it's us again 
You thought you were our friends 
Success is an ugly word 
Especially in your tiny world 

The masses against the classes 
I'm tired of giving a reason 
When the future is what we believe in 
We love the winter, it brings us closer together 

So can you hurt us any more 
Can you feel like it was before 
Or are you lost for evermore 
Messed up and dead on alcohol 

Hello fond farewell my dear 
I hope you hear this nice and clear 
Our love is unconditional 
Our hate is yours to feed upon 

The masses against the classes 
I'm tired of giving a reason 
When we're the only thing left to believe in 
We love the winter, it brings us closer together 

The masses against the classes 
I'm tired of giving a reason 
When the future is what we believe in 
We love the winter, it brings us closer together
