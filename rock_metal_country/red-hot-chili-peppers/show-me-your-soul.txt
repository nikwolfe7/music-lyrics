Verse 1
In a world that can be so insane
I don't think it's very strange
For me to be in love with you
I wanna know more than your brain

Into my life you were injected
Not something that I expected
Now I smile from your affection
We have made a soul connection
Just for whom does your bell toll
Don't be cold show me your soul

Chorus
Sentimental Gentlemen are not afraid to show you when
I am you, you're my best friend
Show me your soul

Verse 2
In a world that can be so insane
I don't think it's very strange
For me to be in love with you
I wanna know more than your brain

Yes, I find you so appealing
When you show me how you're feeling
You, my friend, should not be kneeling
Open up and start revealing
Trust in me my heart is sole
I need to see, show me your soul

Chorus

Verse 3
In a world that can be so insane
I don't think it's very strange
For me to be in love with you
I wanna know more than your brain

Don't expect too much from me
Perfection is no test for me
Because the best I'll ever be
Is just like you: A human being
You won't offend, I need to know
Please, my friend, show me your soul

Chorus
