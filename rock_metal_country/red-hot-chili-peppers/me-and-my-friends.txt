Me and my, me and my, me and my,
me and my, me and my friends

Like two sweet peas
in an even sweeter pod
that's my friend
and my friends's named Bob
like the devil knows hell
I know Bob well
well enough to tell you
'bout his 67 smells
well enough to tell you
he's a hell-a-swell fellow
well enough to tell you
that we know each other better
than we know our selves
like freaks of a feather
we rock together
I know Bob well
but I think he knows me better

Me and my, me and my, me and my,
me and my, me and my friends

He's as close to me
as a friend can be
I'll be standin' by my buddy
he'll be standin' by me
just another half of
the two headed freak
but I need him like
my heart needs to beat
at this point
in this friendly verse
I've got to sing a little something
that I haven't rehearsed
it's about my man
and his name is Hillel
for who my love
is woul brother sacred
take it hickleberry
slim boy take it

Me and my, me and my, me and my,
me and my, me and my friends

Jacky's eyes are closed
but he's right on course
because he's guided by
the invisible force
he drives a kooky green chrysler
bad as anybody's porsche
he's a working class drummer
he's as strong as a horse

Me and my, me and my, me and my,
me and my, me and my friends
