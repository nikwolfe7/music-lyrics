Life is my friend
Rake it up to take it in
Wrap me in your cinnamon
Especially in Michigan
...well I could be your friend

White clouds I'm in
A mitten full of fisherman
C'mon huckleberry finn
Show me how to make her grin
...well I'm in Michigan

Cry me a future
Where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and tigers come running
Just to steal your luck

A rainy Lithuanian
Who's dancing as an Indian
Painted in my tiger skin
Especially in Michigan

Double chins and bowling pins
Unholy presbyterians
Land is full of medicine
I find it when I'm slipping in
...into Michigan

The tainted new librarian
Who fainted when she tucked you in
Let's float away like zeppelins
on stoic gusts of northern wind

Out on the farm we'll be
Swimming with the mother duck
Deep in the mitten where
Lions and tigers come running
Just to steal your luck

Life is my friend
Underwater violins
Order now from ho chi min
A porcelain that comes in twins
...when I'm in Michigan

Throw me in the looney bin
Cause I can take it on the chin
The cleavage of your pillow skin
Is moving like a violin
