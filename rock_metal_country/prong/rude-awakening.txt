Another rude awakening. The hard life that's been our school. More of a cruel day's reckonings. Our prime time used up too
soon. There is no kindness to waste- Why help those crying for more? It spins you around, takes you for a ride. What is the
point to even try? Somehow got to learn to accept the rejection. The tired thoughts from troubling. A weary mind from
worrying. Your constant fears upon wakening. Your real life left in your dreams.
