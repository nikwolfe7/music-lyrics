It's over before it starts 
Oh don't you know 
So on your marks and stand by
Ready, go 
From London to New York, Montreal to Tokyo
I see visions of her everywhere I go
What have I become
Now that I'm all alone 

I'm just looking for a way to break through these walls and
I'm just looking for a place that I can call my home and
Is anybody out there got a soul
'Cuz I'm just looking for a girl
The girl with a heart of gold 

She always  once  count with her champagne case
She goes straight down the rathole with her
Total recklessness and
Tomorrow will come on through
And I got nothing but a barely mentioned
Nothing but a sillouette girl
Met her in darkness
I say 

What have I become
Now that I'm all alone 

I'm just looking for a way to break through these walls and
I'm just looking for a place that I can call my home and
Is anybody out there got a soul
'Cuz I'm just looking for a girl
The girl with a heart of gold
I said I'm just looking for a girl
The girl with a heart of gold 

Yeah I'm in the corner I start over
I start the whole slate clean
All the pain and heartache in all my years
I was always to blame
And I dream of this girl 
Yeah an angelical ghost
I met her in my neighborhood
I'm a downtown member 
Don't let me be misunderstood
Oh, I'm a downtown member 
Don't let me be misunderstood 

Heart of gold!!! 

I'm just looking for a way to break through these walls and
I'm just looking for a place that I can call my home and
Is anybody out there got a soul 
'Cuz I'm just looking for a girl 
The girl with a heart of gold 

I said I'm just looking for a girl 
The girl with a heart of gold
