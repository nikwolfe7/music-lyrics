Hitched a ride to the peaceful side of town 
Then proceeded where thieves were no longer found 
Can't crash now I've been waiting for this 
Won't crash now I found some encouragement 
Precious declaration reads 
Yours is yours and mine you leave alone now 
Precious declaration says 
I believe all hope is dead no longer 

New meanings to the words I feed upon 
Wake within my veins elements of freedom 
Can't break now I've been living for this 
Won't break now I'm cleansed with hopefulness 
Precious declaration says 
Yours is yours and mine you leave alone now 
Precious declaration says 
I believe all hope is dead no longer 

Once I jumped thru hoops of fire 
High and far as you required 
I was blind but now I see 
Salvation has discovered me
