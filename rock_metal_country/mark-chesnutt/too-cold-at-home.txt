Well, it sure feels good to come in here 
And just pull up a seat 
A frosty mug of a cool one 
Helps to beat the heat 
These old dog days of summer 
Lord, I'll be glad when they're gone 
It's too hot to fish, too hot for golf 
And TOO COLD AT HOME. 
Well, that baseball game on TV 
Takes me back to when I was a kid 
We proudly wore those uniforms 
Just like the Dodgers did 
Yea!, we won a few and and we lost a few 
And for me it still goes on 
Too hot to fish, and too hot for golf 
And TOO COLD AT HOME. 
CHORUS 
Well, I only planned on one or two 
I might stay for three 
If that good-lookin' thing in the corner 
Keeps smilin' back at me 
It's so easy not to care 
'Bout what's right or what's wrong 
It's too hot to fish, too hot for golf  
And TOO COLD AT HOME. 
CHORUS 
It's too hot to fish, too hot for golf  
And TOO COLD AT HOME.
