You think this life would make me bolder 
But I'm running scared is all 
I hang on everything about you 
You think I'd settle down cuz I'm older 
But I roll with the changes is all 
I'm same old trailer trash in new shoes 

She gets sad when there's nothing going on 
She says it makes her feel damn worthless 

chorus 1 

Well you got to think with a girl like that 
Any love at all, is better than nothing 
It's better than nothing 

I put my hands around your shoulder 
You're saying you're scared is all 
I think I know too much about you 
You think this life would make me colder 
I'd give in to the alcohol 
I put my loving arms around you, child 

You knew damn well there was nothing going on 
Is that what makes you feel damn worthless 

chorus 2 

Well you got to think with a girl like that 
Any love is better than nothing 
It's better than nothing 
You got to think, with a girl like that 
Any love at all, is better than nothing 
It's better than nothing 
Yeah she drags you down and she pulls you up 
She pulls you up 
Says that she's sorry now but it's not enough 
To pull you up 
She's sorry 

I wake up quick just like I want to 
Yeah but I stay out much too late 
You think this life can get a bit unkind but she stays 
Down till the worth is gone 
And pulls you up, she pulls you up, 
She pulls you up and over, over
