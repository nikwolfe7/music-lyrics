Kody sat down on the avenue 
He tapped his feet, to the humming of the highway 
He watched the light shine down on the broken glass and thought 
I don't got no reasons, yet 
There it is and there it was 
It was clear to all of us 
We kept this hat of broken dreams 
And we pulled them out, when we needed them around 

[chorus]

So please hand me the bottle, I think I'm lonely now 
And please give me direction, I think the hurt set in 
And I don't feel nothing 

There's a squeak hinge down on the back gate 
It lets us know if he comes around 
I don't sleep that good anyway 
If you've never heard the silence, it's a God awful sound 

[chorus]

I don't feel nothing, no I don't feel nothing 
There's nothing to feel good about here 

Don't much get down to the avenue 
I could drive, but it takes so much to get there 
Don't get off on all the broken glass, the cadillac scene, 
Well 
I've seen a lot of good things die and I'm 
In an over emotional way 

[chorus]
