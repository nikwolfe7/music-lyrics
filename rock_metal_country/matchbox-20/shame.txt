What we learned here is love tastes bitter when it's gone 
Past yourself forget the light, things look dirty when it's on 
Funny how it comes to pass, that all the good slips away 
And there's no one around you can remember being good to 
You 

[chorus 1]
Shame, shouldn't try you, couldn't step by you 
And open up more 
Shame, shame, shame 

What we lost here is something better left alone 
Second steps have been forgotten, will you tell me how 
They go 
Set yourself, situate, like a fool try again 
There's no one around you can remember being good, for you 
So 

[chorus 2]
Shame, shouldn't try you, couldn't step by you 
And open up more 
Shame, shame, shame 
Shame, shouldn't try you, couldn't step by you 
And open up more 
Shame, shame, shame 

We never thought we'd get so troubled 
We could never think that much 
It should never get this bad 

So let the wind blow ya, across a big floor 
But there's no one around who can tell us what we're here 
For 
Funny in a certain light, how we all look the same 
And there's no one in life you can remember ever stood 
For you, so
