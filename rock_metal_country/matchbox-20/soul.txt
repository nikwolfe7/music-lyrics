Hang out my window and over your head
Stare at your feelings to see where they end
You're waiting here for someone else to break you from the inside
You've been so composed

[Chorus]

We all know there's always something tearing you apart
It's always so much longer than you counted on
And it hits you so much harder than you thought
But you don't worry, you don't worry
Cause you've got soul

You're so heavy, you're so misunderstood
And I spent all my wishes wishing times were good
When I still could
Wait around here for someone else to take me past the good side
You've been here so long now

[Chorus]

We all know there's always something tearing you apart
It's always so much longer than you counted on
And it hits you so much harder then you thought
But you don't worry, you don't worry
Cause darling, you've got so much soul
Darling, you've got so much soul

[Chorus]

Well, there's always something tearing you apart
It's always so much longer than you counted on
And it hits you so much harder then you thought
Then you ever thought it would

But you don't worry, and you don't worry
Cause you don't worry, you don't worry
Cause you don't worry, you don't worry
Cause you've got soul
