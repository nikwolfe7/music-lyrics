Lyrics: Lenny Wolf & Carol Tatum
Oh, just another bloody day 
I've gone the ways they said that I should go 
And now sands of time have brought decay 
The hand of fate is in control 
Oh, thousand voices calling me 
To sail the seas that only I would know 
I hear human sirens everywhere 
Their evil tongues have turrned to stone
Chorus: 
Shoud I, should I 
Pretend and close my eyes: 
Should I, should I 
Sit in or just one more time 
Should I, should I 
Hold back just to survive 
Should I, should I 
Give in like other times before
