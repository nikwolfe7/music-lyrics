sleighbells ring, are you list'nin? 
in the lane snow is glist'nin 
a beautiful sight 
we're happy tonight 
walkin' in a winter wonderland! 

gone away is the bluebird 
here to stay is the new bird 
he sings a love song 
as we go along 
walkin' in a winter wonderland! 

in the meadow we can build a snowman 
then pretend that he is parson brown 
he'll say, "are you married?" 
we'll say, "no, man! 
but you can do the job when you're in town!" 

later on we'll conspire 
as we dream by the fire 
to face unafraid 
the plans that we made 
walkin' in a winter wonderland! 

in the meadow we can build a snowman 
and pretend that he's a circus clown 
we'll have lots of fun with mr. snowman 
until the other kiddies knock him down! 

when it snows, ain't it thrillin' 
though your nose gets a chillin'? 
we'll frolic and play 
the eskimo way 
walkin' in a winter wonderland! 
walkin' in a winter wonderland! 

walkin' in a winter wonderland! 
sleighbells ring are you listenin' 
walkin' in a winter wonderland! 
sleighbells ring are you listenin' 
in the lane snow is glistenin' 
walkin' in a winter wonderland! 
are you listenin', sleighbells ring are you listenin' 
walkin' in a winter wonderland! 
sleighbells ring are you listenin', sleighbells ring  
walkin' in a winter wonderland!
