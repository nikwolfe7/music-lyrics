Listen, heart
Listen close-listen
2 the melancholy
Melody of your own voice
I am weary of my own dreaming
I am tired of waiting
So this time, I'm leaping

[CHORUS]

I reach-beyond myself 2 see
What I find, beyond my mind, there is no time
In this place beyond my sight
My heart knows what is not yet seen
I'm witnessing my own becoming

Lash myself 2 the
Mantle of my desire-I will
Turn from its temptations
But the wanting takes me higher

I am hurting
Oh, I am not yet born
I am the mother and the father
Of what is not yet known
Darkness surrounds me
I scratch, I struggle, I breathe

[CHORUS]
