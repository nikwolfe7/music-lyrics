Make your way through mirrored halls
See the boys with all their dolls
A pretty maze, like candied streets
U feel a thrill when your eyes meet
U pick the one with the feathered hair
But I'm the one that makes the boys stare
There's a room, or so I'm told
Where the DJ rocks and we don't grow old
Would u like 2 take a ride?
All u have 2 do is come inside

[CHORUS]

Say hello 2 the room where the party's jumpin'
Where the boys all freak 'cause boots are bumpin'
Where the girls are naughty and always saying
"Yes u can, yes u can, yes u can"

U got on your money rags
And Papa's got a brand new bag
And Mama's got her hot pants on
While in the back, the beat goes on
Would u like 2 come along?
Then shut up and sing this song

[CHORUS]

The boys are pale
The girls are soft as nails
The band strikes up and it starts 2 wail
There's a price on everything
It's not cheap 2 buy your dreams

[CHORUS]
