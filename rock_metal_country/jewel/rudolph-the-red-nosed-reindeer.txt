Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer 
had a very shiny nose 
and if you ever saw it 
you would even say it glows 
all of the other reindeer 
used to laugh and call him names 
they never let poor Rudolph 
join in any reindeer games 
then one foggy Christmas eve 
Santa came to say: 
"Rudolph with your nose so bright 
won't you guide my sleigh tonight" 
then how the reindeer loved him 
as they shouted out with glee yippee 
"Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer 
you'll go down in history."
