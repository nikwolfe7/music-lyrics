Running fast through a fairy tale
Dark woods; starless night
Feel cold air in my lungs
Full moon, u follow me-u say
"Why do hearts so often stray?"
U pierce me like an arrow
Beneath the blanket of night
Longing for flight

[CHORUS]

When u fall into me
It feels so sweet, like dreaming
Press yourself into me
Let me feel your breathing
There's a voice in your heart
Softly calling
Come 2 me u will see, just give in
2 this sweet temptation

I awake, do a double take 2 see
Where it is that I lay-it could be
Day or night, I'm not quite sure
Your absence is a thorn
Your flesh, your skin
Is the only flag there is 2 believe in

[CHORUS]

I can love u like nobody else

When u fall into me
It feels so sweet, like dreaming
Press yourself into me
Let me feel your breathing
There's a voice in your heart
Softly calling

[CHORUS]
