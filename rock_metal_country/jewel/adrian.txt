Adrian came home again last summer
Things just haven't been the same around here
People talk
People stare
Oh, Adrian, come out and play
An unfortunate accident in a canoe
Dr. said, 'I'm sorry not much I can do'
The air was so still
His eyes did not blink
Oh, Adrian, come out and play
Little Mary Epperson liked him
She vowed always to watch after him
Still he did not move
Dr. said it's no use
Oh, Adrian, come out and play
She sat by his side, watched the years fly by
He looked so fragile, he looked so small
She wondered why he was still alive at all
Everyone in town had that 'I'm sorry look'
They talked in a whispered hush, said
'I'd turn the machines off'
But still she sat by his side
Said, 'Life he won't be denied
Oh, Adrian, come out and play
Yellow flowers decorate his bedroom
Sign above his door says 'Welcome Home'
But he just sits and stares
He's awake but he's still not there
Oh, Adrian, come out and play
She sat by his side, watched the years fly by
He looked so fragile, he looked so small
She wondered why he was still alive at all
Little Mary Epperson grew up lovely
She still comes to visit him on Sundays
He's like an unused toy
He's got big hands but the mind of a little boy
Oh, Adrian, come out and play
Adrian came home again last summer
Things just haven't been the same around here
