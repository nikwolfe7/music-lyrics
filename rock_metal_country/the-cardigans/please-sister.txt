With a sampled heartbeat and a stolen soul
I sold my songs to have my fortune told
And it said
You should know that love will never die
But see how it kills you in the blink of an eye

I know love is a hot white light
It knocks you down and then leaves you dry
Oh how can it be sweet mama tell me why
Why all loves disciples have to wither and die

Please sister, help me come on do what you should
Please give me something I'm not doing so good
I'm gone, done wrong is there nothing you can say
Please sister help me I'm not feeling ok

Give me believe that my time will come
And a toll free helpline if I find someone
But she said
You gave away what you never really had
And now your purse is empty I can see why you're sad

Please sister, help me come on do what you should
Please give me something I'm not doing so good
I'm gone, done wrong is there nothing you can say
Please sister help me 
Can you make me feel ok

So if it's true, that love will never die
Then why do the lovers work so hard
To stay alive

Please sister, help me
Please give me something oh
Please sister, you know I do what I can
Oh sweet mama, please descent me a man
Cause I'm gone, gone
Is there nothing you can get
Please sister help me I just need some love
To live
Just a little love to live
