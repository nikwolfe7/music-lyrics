Day by day, watching you disappear
Wishing that you were still here beside me
On my own, swimming against the tide
There's nobody on my side but your memory
Then you'll rise right before my eyes
On wings that fill the sky
Like a pheonix rising
Like a pheonix rising
Wings on fire, tearing into the night
Screaming into the light of another day
Carry me out the hurricane
Into the smoke and flame and we'll fly away
And we'll rise right before their eyes
On wings that fill the sky
Like a pheonix rising
Like a pheonix rising
Higher, higher, hear the thunder roar from above
Fire, fire, fire makes me whole
Into the smoke and flame and we'll fly away
And we'll rise right before their eyes
On wings that fill the sky
Like a pheonix rising
Like a pheonix rising
Wings on fire, tearing in to the night
