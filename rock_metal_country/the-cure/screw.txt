When you screw up your eyes
When you screw up your face
When you throw out your arms
And keep changing your shape
Taste the taste in your mouth
Taste the taste on your tongue
On the film on your eyes of what I've become

What do I do when you screw up your eyes
What do I do when you screw up your face
What do I do
When you throw out your arms
Fall on the floor
And keep changing your shape
Jump right into your mouth
Jump around on your tongue

And the film on your eyes of the way I've become
Makes me sick at the way that I try
Anything in the world
To impress that I'm doing this
Only for you
