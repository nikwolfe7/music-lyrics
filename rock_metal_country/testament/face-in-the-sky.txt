Shadows glow from the full moonlight
Hear clouds cry, it's so insane
Souls hold on to the key of life
See how it's bleeding from the pain

When will they open their eyes
Stop to face our demise
It's live or die
Who am I
Face in the sky

Walk with me, my friend to a darkness place
Welcome down to the abyss
Caught between two worlds with no advocate
The legion's army
Holds on to your fate

When will they open their eyes
Stop to face our demise
It's live or die
Who am I
Face in the sky

Screams from the night
Seems to intensify
As the air sifts silent through
Ghouls crowded in the clouds
On a misty night
Guarding secret
Man has brought to you

When will they open their eyes
Stop to face our demise
It's live or die
Who am I
Face in the sky
