When every trust you hold
And every truth you're told
Goes up in a cloud of smoke
And every lesson learned
Every corner turned
Ends up as a winding road
Don't be afraid

Sometimes you've got to talk into the dark
To find your way beyond the shadows
Shadows of your heart

Oh oh oh
Keep the faith, Keep the faith
Ohhh Keep the faith
Keep the faith, yeah yeah yeah
When you're still searchin'
Keep the faith, keep the faith, keep the faith
You've gotta just believe
And remember, remember to keep the faith
Keep the faith, keep the faith, keep the faith

Oh I don't know why
No matter how I try
I manage to lose my way
Covered up in doubt
No easy way out
Oooo takin' it day by day

I don't have the answers
Sometimes I, I don't know if I'm strong enough
But when I feel like givin' up
I've got to remind myself
Ohhh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh
Keep the faith, Keep the faith
Ohhh Keep the faith
Keep the faith, yeah yeah yeah
When you're still searchin'
Keep the faith, keep the faith, keep the faith
You've gotta just believe
And remember, remember to keep the faith
Keep the faith, keep the faith, keep the faith

Oh no You don't have to climb
Oh no Any mountain
Oh no You don't have to move
Oh no You don't have to see
Oh no You don't have to know
Yeahhh, oh just remember

Oh oh oh
Keep the faith, Keep the faith
Ohhh Keep the faith
Keep the faith, yeah yeah yeah
When you're still searchin'
Keep the faith, keep the faith, keep the faith
You've gotta just believe
And remember, remember to keep the faith
Keep the faith, keep the faith, keep the faith

Yeah, just believe, just believe
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
