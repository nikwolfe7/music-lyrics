The news is out all over town
That you've been seen out runnin' around
I know that I should leave but then
I just can't go you win again
This heart of mine could never
See what everybody knew but me
Just trusting you was my great sin what can
I do you win again
I'm sorry for your victim now
Cause soon his head like mine will bow
He'll give his heart but all in vain
And someday say you win again
You have no heart you got no shame
You take true love and give the blame
I guess that I should not complain
I love you still you won again
I love you still you won again.
