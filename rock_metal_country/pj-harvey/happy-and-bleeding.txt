She'd burst
Dropped off
Picked the fruit
Realise
I'm naked
I'm naked too

So cover my body
Dress it fine
Hide my linen and lace
Been sewing ever since
Since time began

More than the hills
More than the trees
More than the mountains, you
More than I can see
In front of me
More than the mountains, you

So fruit flower myself inside out
I'm happy and bleeding for you
Fruit flower myself inside out
I'm tired and I'm bleeding for you

This fruit was bruised
Dropped off and blue
Out of season
Happy I'm bleeding
Long overdue
Too early and it's late too
Too early and it's late too
Mind and body
I wouldn't and I would not do

Fruit flower myself inside out
I'm happy and bleeding for you
Fruit flower myself inside out
I'm tired and I'm bleeding for you

Fig fruit flower myself inside out for you
Happy I'm bleeding, happy I'm
