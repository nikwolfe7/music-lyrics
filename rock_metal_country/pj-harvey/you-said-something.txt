On a rooftop in Brooklyn 
At one in the morning 
Watching the lights flash 
In Manhattan 
I see five bridges 
The Empire State Building 
And you said something 
That I've never forgotten 

We lean against railings 
Describing the colours 
And the smells of our homelands 
Acting like lovers 
How did we get here? 
To this point of living? 
I held my breath 
And you said something 

And I'm doing nothing wrong 
Riding in your car 
The radio playing 
We sing up to the eighth floor 
A rooftop, Manhattan 
At one in the morning 
And you said something 
That I've never forgotten 

You said something 
You said something 
You said something 
That was really important
