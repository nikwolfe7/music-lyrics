Good times for a change
See the luck i've had
Would make a good man turn bad
So please please please
Let me let me let me
Let me get what i want
This time
Haven't had a dream in a long time
See, the life i've had would make a good man bad
So for once in my life
Let me get what i want
Lord knows it would be the first time
