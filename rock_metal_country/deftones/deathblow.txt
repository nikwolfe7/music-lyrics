Soon as you came in, all the beast went away
They noticed that you're warm, wait till you leave then come back for more...
The ropes hang to keep us all awake and I should have known
As soon as you came in, the agony went away
I noticed what you wore to everything we spoke and more...
And the ropes hang to keep us all awake and I should have known
It only takes one break of your pose to get off
To save our place... home with you... still the same song...
As soon as you came in is when I believe we both crashed course
And the ropes hang to keep us all awake and I should have known
It only takes one break of your pose to get off
And to save our place home with you all
That's all it takes
Well I should have known it's still the same song
