Somehow calm as she walks on stage
Her entire empire becomes your taste...your taste...show me...come
Let me know what you're like...let me...know what you're like...
What's your taste?
I bet she carves your heart when she walks onstage
Her empire slowly becomes your place... your place...show me...come on
Let me know what you're like...let me...know what you're like...
In your place... your place...
Somehow calm as she walks offstage
An entire empire recall your face...your face...show me...come
Let me know what you're like...let me... know what you're like...
Your face...your face...
