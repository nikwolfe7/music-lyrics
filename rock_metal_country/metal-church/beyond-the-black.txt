The war is over
inaudible line
in the late 1900's, there is no human race
We split the planet with atomic bursts
Man has died
We steal [seal?] [see over?] the Earth
Negotiations are over
Troops are marching to their doom
All that I see is gonna hate me
The smoke is blotting out the view moon?
No, God please stop this bloody slaughter
Well, it's on the streets attack?
All the masses are preparing rebelling?
To withstand the dark attack
Will we make it back beyond the black?
Tanks are rolling in New York in millions?
See them come, and now they're gone
[inaudible line]
They said it came from just one bomb
No God please stop this bloody slaughter
Let it all repeat -- attack
All the masses are preparing rebelling?
To withstand the dark attack
Will we make it back beyond the black?
Will we make it back beyond?
Out of the face and aim for the heart
Seems the night has won
[inaudible line]
The war has just begun
Look out!
Fools who are blind got their worthless guns
Turn the young into old
Blinded by the knives in their hearts
I bet you fear the loss
Look out!
[Screams]
Watch out!
Beyond the black!!!!!!!
