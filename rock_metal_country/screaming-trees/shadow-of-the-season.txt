The hour is ending, can't you see
There is no way now, to get free
In the shadow of the season
Without a reason, to carry on
Without a reason, without a reason

And from the north woods
Down to the valley
In a world of hurting, I'm moving on
And from the lighthouse
Out on the ocean
Can't climb the mountain, so very tall

Said Lord please give me what I need
He said there's pain and misery
Oh sweet oblivion feels alright

The hour is drawing ever closer
And rolling over, won't let me be
In the shadow of the season
To find a reason, to carry onSaid Lord please give me what I need
He said there's pain and misery
Oh sweet oblivion

She calls me onward to her side
And feels her song deep inside 
And find a reason

In the shadow of the season
To find a reason to carry on
In the shadow of the season
To find a reason to carry on
Find a reason to carry on
To carry on
To find a reason to carry on
To carry on
