Try to hide myself
Give this to someone else
My hands are stained with scum
Wish I could wash it away
You keep taking, taking away
And keep breaking, breaking, break

I can't believe in yesterday
I feel you coming in
I can't just stand by and watch you
Save yourself as you fall from grace
When you come around, I won't be your sympathy

The worst is over now
You said it anyhow
My life in monochrome
Wish I could regain control
You keep taking, taking away
I keep faking, faking, fake

Find me, feel me fill me, then cut me up again
Find me, feel me the cut me up

HATE
ME
HATE
