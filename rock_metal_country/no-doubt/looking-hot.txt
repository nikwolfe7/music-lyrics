Go ahead and look at me
'Cause that's what I want
Take a good look won't you please
'Cause that's what I want

I know you wanna stare
You can't help it and I don't care
So look at me
'Cause that's what I want

Do you think I'm looking hot?
Do you think this hits the spot?
How is this looking on me, looking on me

Do you think I'm looking hot?
Do you think this hits the spot?
How is this looking on me, looking on me

Go ahead and stare,
And take a picture please,
If you need.
And I think that says it all.

Chasing it, I don't know why
I think about it a lot
Better hurry, running out of time
I think about it a lot

I can't tell anymore
I don't know what I'm looking for
You know what I mean
I think about it a lot

Do you think I'm looking hot?
Do you think this hits the spot?
How is this looking on me, looking on me

Do you think I'm looking hot?
Do you think this hits the spot?
How is this looking on me, looking on me

Go ahead and stare,
And take a picture please,
If you need.
And I think that says it all.

Running on empty but I have had plenty
You're complimentary, but I'm just pretending
Uniform, hide behind there, this is my diversion
Go ahead and stare I'm a ragamuffin.

Don't Feel it, So fake it
I bait it, you take it
One eye in the mirror, put on my veneer
I could have sworn, it's a sure shot
Are you under my con,
Go ahead and stare I'm a ragamuffin.

Do you think I'm looking hot?

Go ahead and stare
And take a picture please, if you need
And I think that says it all.
