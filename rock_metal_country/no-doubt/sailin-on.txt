Ooh...

You don't want me anymore 
So I walk out of the door 
I play the game right from the start 
I trust you, you use me, now my life's all torn apart 

So I'm sailing, yeah I'm sailing on 
I'm moving, yeah I'm moving on 
Sail on sail on sail on sail on - aaaaah 

Tried to see if I'll give up 
But there wasn't any luck 
It's a fact, a fact of life 
That's the game, game of strife everything is all in stride 

So I'm sailing, I'm sailing on 
I'm moving, yeah I'm moving on 
Sail on sail on sail on sail on - aaaaah 

Yeah

So I'm sailing, yeah I'm sailing on 
I'm moving, yeah I'm moving on 
Sail on sail on sail on sail on - aaaaah 

Yeah la la la 
La la la 
La la la 

Too many years with too many tears 
And too many days with none to say 
So how will we know when there's nowhere to grow 
The fact of life, life too short oh 

There's too many years with too many tears 
There's too many days with none to say no no 
So how will we know when there's nowhere to grow 
The fact of life, the fact of life yeah 

Too many years with too many tears 
And too many days with none to say 
So how will we know when there's nowhere to grow 
The fact of life, life too short oh oh...
