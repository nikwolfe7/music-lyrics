Get back together aah
This is a very interesting situation
I sense a gradual loss of communication
Don't you think I can see you're changing on
me
You're heading into a completely new direction

And I am having trouble making the adaptation

Don't you think I can see you're changing on me

Let's get back together
Let's get back forever
Let's get back together
Let's get back
Let's get back together
Let's get back forever
Let's get back together
Let's get back

If I may be so bold by making a suggestion 
Please ask yourself why you are making this
transition
Don't you think I can see, you're changing on
me

Everytime I think of us I just want to make it
how it was
Before we had much more
When I think of me and you I just can't believe
that we are through
I can't ignore the fact you closed the door

When I think back, we had a beautiful
relationship
But I see the future, what's there for me is
devastation from you
Don't you think I can see, you're changing on
me

Let's get back together
Let's get back forever
Let's get back together
Let's get back
Let's get back together
Let's get back forever
Let's get back together
Let's get back

Back together, back together, back together,
back together
Back together, back together, back together,
back together

Everytime I think of us I just want to make it
how it was
Ah before we had much more
When I think of me and you I just can't believe
that we are through
I can't ignore the fact you closed the door

Don't you think IEcan see
Don't you think I can see
Don't you think I can see
You're changing

Get on back, get on back
Get on back, get on back
Get on back, get on back
Get on back, get on back
Get on back, get on back
Get on back, get on back to
I wanna get back
