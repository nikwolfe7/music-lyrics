b-side from the Ex-Girlfriend single 

Thinking what should I do 
Now I don't have you 
Facing my demotion 
I'm just a fish in your ocean 
Has been, that's what I am 
With my backstage wristband 
Freaking seconds of you 
That's not what I'm used to 

Feed, feed 'em all to me 
Careful with my stuff 
What's your policy 
First one's free 

I save 'em up, I put 'em in my pocket 
I save 'em up, put 'em in a jar 
I save 'em up, I'm gonna need 'em for later 
I save 'em up, then they'll go real far 

Hand me downs, the takedowns 
I take the leftovers 
Cold ones and the old ones 
Better than no ones 

Feed, feed 'em all to me 
Careful with my stuff 
What's your policy 
First one's free 

I save 'em up, I put 'em in my pocket 
I save 'em up, put 'em in a jar 
I save 'em up, I need 'em for later 
I save 'em up, then they'll go real far 

I time it out, gotta be real careful 
I time it out, get 'em right on time 
I time it out, I get 'em when I need 'em 
Time is up, what's left is over 

It's over 
I can never have enough 
Oh, I can never have enough 
I sure am greedy 
Hand 'em over to me 

Nothing's free 

I save 'em up, I put 'em in my pocket 
I save 'em up, put 'em in a jar 
I save 'em up, gonna need 'em for later 
I save 'em up, then they'll go real far 

I time it out, I'll be real careful 
I time it out, get 'em right on time 
I time it out, I get 'em when I need 'em 
Time is up, what's left is over 

Oh, I need 'em, 
Yeah, I need 'em 
Because I need 'em 
Time is up, what's left is over 
I time it out, I time it out 
Because I need 'em, I really need 'em 

What should I do, now I don't have you? 
I really need 'em, I really need 'em 
Hand me downs, the takedowns 
I take the leftovers
