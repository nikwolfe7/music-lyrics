Go ahead, get out and see the world 
But then I think, why should I 
I'd rather stay home and cry
I never thought that I could be the other 
The other way like the other ones 
Let me open wide, let you see inside 
And then you might agree

Would you say they find me unstable 
'Cause they see me act a little bit different 
But I know my way to greener pastures and 
Think about it, won't you think it over 
Please

Without you I can move 
I can stretch my arms out, I can feel it 
And when I'm in my room alone I feel good 
Because I don't have to deal with you or the outside world

Would you say they find me unstable 
'Cause they see me act a little bit different 
But I know my way to greener pastures and 
Think about it, won't you think it over 
Please

I guess I'll get over it 
Ooh - I guess I'll get over it 
I guess I'll get over it 
I guess I'll get over it

Would you say they find me unstable 
'Cause they see me act a little bit different
But I know my way through greener pastures 
Would you say they find me unstable 
'Cause they see me act a little bit different 
But I know my way through greener pastures 
Would you say they find me unstable 
'Cause they see me act a little bit different 
But I know my way through greener pastures 
Greener pastures 
See me act a little bit different 
But I know my way through greener pastures
