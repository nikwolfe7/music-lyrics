Open the basket 
Listen to the flute play 
Open the basket 
Listen to the flute play 
Toot toot toot play

Snakes in the basket 
Lie to lead you astray 
Snakes in the basket 
Force to make you betray 
Your innermost truth hidden away

Now you're falling down to the underground
Slither down to your lair 
Hidden in the many trenches of a hopeless war 
Those who were sold out by a corporate board

Carry the casket 
Never mind the gun spray 
Bury the casket 
Pawns in someone's gameplay 
Shoot shoot shoot obey

Now you're falling down to the underground 
Slither down to your lair 
Hidden in the many trenches of a hopeless war 
Those who were sold out by a corporate board

Listen to the flute play 
Listen to the flute play 
Listen to the flute play

Subscription to the spreading of lies 
Soldier catches a glimpse of his demise deep down inside 
Even he knows snakes come in many shapes and sizes 
Many shapes and sizes 
Snakes have no hands to be tied

Concoction of malicious lies 
Deep inside the general despises himself 
Listen to the flute play 
Another reptile in line 
Snakes without grass cannot hide

Now you're falling down to the underground
Slither down to your lair 
Hidden in the many trenches of a hopeless war 
Those who were sold out by a corporate board 
Now you're falling down to the underground 
Slither down to your lair 
Forked tongues spread the poison with another toxic sting 
So much pain their serpentine inhibitions bring

Oh - listen to the flute play 
Listen to the flute play 
Listen to the flute play 
Listen to the flute play

Open the basket 
Open the basket 
Listen to the flute play 
Open the basket

Listen to the flute play 
Listen to the flute play 
Go ahead 
Listen to the flute play

Open the basket 
Oh - open the basket
