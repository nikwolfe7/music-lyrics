Please Miss Fried
He don't mean to be mean 
He just needs to leave
He hopes he does not 
Cause you inconvenience 
Why can't you see
He said, "please don't be sad for me"
Oh Miss Fried
Please believe you're his queen
He must fight for his dreams
Lovely Miss Fried
He will too miss you 
He just needs to be free

He says, "If I should ever cause you to bleed...
don't pretend to be naive"
Don't be naive

Don't take him wrong, let him be
Sometimes he feels like he oughta be alone,
lone
Don't take him wrong, let him be
Sometimes he feels like he oughta be alone,
lone

He says, "Please don't be sad for me,
Please don't be sad for me."
