Never ever, ever gonna be the same
Never gonna be the same
Its nothing new youve gone missing before
People like you fade in and out
Somehow we got lost in the travels
Why did the world unravel us
And how it was?
Sometimes I feel like I just passed you by
And left you standing in your pain
But you were the one with the magic
You were the one with the sparkle
And you had it all
I know its never gonna be the way it was
How can it?
Feelings change and people can get lost
But I still think of you so much
Do you remember how it was?
Never ever, ever gonna be the same
Never gonna be the same
So what you doing while the day goes by?
And what you thinking in your head?
I just want you to be happy
Please let me know if you are, the way you were
I know its never gonna be the way it was
How can it?
Feelings change and people can get lost
But I still think of you so much
Do you remember how it was?
I know its never gonna be the way it was
How can it?
Feelings change and people can get lost
But I still think of you so much
Do you remember how it was?
Never gonna be the way it was
How can it?
Feelings change and people can get lost
But I still care about you so much
Do you remember how it was?
I still care about you so much
