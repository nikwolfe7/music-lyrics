I don't miss where I came from
But each night I dream about being back home
When I wake up in the morning
I'm too tired, tired of being alone
So I get up and go downtown
And pick me out a little piece of ground 
Where I can prove something to the world
I can prove something to the world
Don't look at me
I'm the bus stop boxer X2
Daddy put us in the truck and
Dropped us off and said good luck, then
One lucky kid waiting for the bus
Made a winner out of one of us
Don't look at me
I'm the bus stop boxer X2
Going down by the railroad tracks, where
People know that they better not relax
I'm the man, baby, I am the man
This is where I can make you understand
I'm the bus stop boxer
Don't look at me X2
