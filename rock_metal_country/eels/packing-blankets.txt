Today is a lovely day
Start up the car with the sun
Packing blankets and dirty sheets
A roomful of dust and a broom to sweep up
All the troubles you and i have seen
Cross when the drawbridge light is green
Don't look back to that messed-up scene
Packing blankets and dirty sheets
A roomful of dust and a broom to sweep up
All the troubles you and i have seen
And all our troubles will be gone
Blowing out over the bridge
Floating up into the sky
Making the storm clouds cry
Put out that smoke and breath some air
Get a new name and cut your hair
