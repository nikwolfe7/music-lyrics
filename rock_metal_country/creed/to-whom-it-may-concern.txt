Oh, I didn't mean to yell 
But sometimes I get beside myself 
And oh, I didn't mean to rush you 
But time keeps pushing so much 
Oh, time keeps pushing so much 
Your eyes stare at me in the dark 
And I hope those eyes 
Don't steal my freedom 
My freedom 
Oh, If I didn't give it all 
When I stood you made me crawl 
And oh, if you never heard the song 
Then I could still hide down behind the wall 
Then I could still hide down behind the wall 
Your eyes stare at me in the dark
And I hope those eyes 
Don't steal my freedom 
My freedom 
And I hope those eyes 
Don't steal my freedom 
My freedom 
Said eyes, those eyes 
I said don't steal my freedom 
Your eyes stare at me in the dark 
And I hope those eyes 
Don't steal my freedom 
My freedom 
Oh, my freedom 
Your eyes stare at me in the dark 
And I hope those eyes 
Don't steal my freedom 
My freedom 
Oh, my freedom 
Said eyes, those eyes 
Said eyes, those eyes 
I said don't steal my freedom
