I spent a day by the river 
It was quiet and the wind stood still
I spent some time with nature 
To remind me of all that's real 
It's funny how silence speaks sometimes when you're alone 
And remember that you feel 
I said it's funny how silence speaks sometimes when you're alone 
And remember that you feel 
Again I stand, Lord I stand,
against the Faceless Man 
Again I stand, Lord I stand, 
against the Faceless Man 

Now I saw a face on the water 
It looked humble but willing to fight 
I saw the will of a warrior 
His yoke is easy and His burden is light 

He looked me right in the eyes 
Direct and concise to remind me 
To always do what's right 
He looked me right in the eyes 
Direct and concise to remind me 
To always do what's right 

Again I stand. Lord I stand,
against the Faceless Man 
Again I stand. Lord, God I stand,
against the Faceless Man 

'Cause if the face inside can't see the light 
I know I'll have to walk alone 
And if I walk alone to the other side 
I know I might not make it home 

Again I stand, Lord I stand,
against the Faceless Man 
Again I stand, Lord I stand,
against the Faceless Man 

Next time I see this face 
I'll say I choose to live for always 
So won't you come inside And never go away 
Next time I see this face 
I'll say I choose to live for always 
So won't you come inside And never go away 

Again I stand, Lord I stand,
against the Faceless Man 
Again I stand, Lord I stand,
against the Faceless Man 
Again I stand, Lord I stand,
against the Faceless Man
