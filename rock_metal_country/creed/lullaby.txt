Hush my love now don't you cry
Everything will be all right
Close your eyes and drift in dream
Rest in peaceful sleep

If there's one thing I hope I showed you
Hope I showed you

Just give love to all

Oh my love...in my arms right
Every day you give me life
As I drift off to your world
Will rest in peaceful sleep

I know there's one thing that you showed me
That you showed me

Just give love to all
Let's give love to all
