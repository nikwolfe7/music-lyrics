you don't know what you've put me through
it's okay, i've forgiven you
but in some way, hope it fucks with you
hope it fucks with you

[pre-chorus]
that i'm okay and i've made it through
but who's to say what you're going through
i'll say no names, though i've wanted to
isn't it strange how it seems like...

[chorus]
yesterday, a boy and already afraid
locked deep inside, my place to hide
to hide from how you made me feel
and i wonder how's your brother
did he end up fucked up like me?
lost in himself, crying for help it's safe to say
i learned to live without a pride
just a shell, with me stuck on the inside
a prison, not a place to hide
not a place to hide

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]
[chorus altered]

yesterday, a boy and already afraid
locked deep inside, my place to hide
to hide from how you made me feel
and i wonder how's your brother
did he finally pull through like me?
finding himself, not needing help
i'd like to say
