Nameless 

The walls around me caving in 
Cracked and grey 
Remind me of myself, I need some help 
There's no one else 
I'm empty 
Addicted 
Pissed off 
And still afraid 
Of what you 
Have left me 
To live in 
This mess you've made 

I feel... 
Useless... 
Jaded... 
Nameless 

the ride is over I've come down 
Hate to be 
Can't rely upon myself, for my own health 
I'm so fucked up 
Distorted 
Dysfunctional 
and drained 
All my deep rooted 
Fears seem to get 
The best of me 

I feel... 
Useless... 
Jaded... 
Nameless 

I hate the way you fuck with me 
You can't rely on open eyes to see 
I force these painful visions from my head 
You won't be happy till I break down 

I feel... 
Useless... 
Jaded... 
Nameless
