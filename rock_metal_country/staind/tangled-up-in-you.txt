You're my world 
The shelter from the rain 
You're the pills 
That take away my pain 
You're the light 
That helps me find my way 
You're the words 
When I have nothing to say 

And in this world 
Where nothing else is true 
Here I am 
Still tangled up in you 
I'm still tangled up in you 
Still tangled up in you 

You're the fire 
That warms me when i'm cold 
You're the hand 
I have to hold as I grow old 
You're the shore 
When I am lost at sea 
You're the only thing 
That I like about me 

And in this world 
Where nothing else is true 
Here I am 
Still tangled up in you 
I'm still tangled up in you 

How long has it been 
Since this storyline began 
And I hope it never ends 
And goes like this forever 

In this world 
Where nothing else is true 
Here I am 
Still tangled up in you 
Tangled up in you 
I'm still tangled up in you 
Still tangled up in you
