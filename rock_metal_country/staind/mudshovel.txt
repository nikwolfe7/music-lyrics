You take away 
I feel the same 

You take away 
I feel the same 
All the promises you made to me you made in vain 
I lost myself inside your tainted smile again 

Cause you can feel my ANGER 
You can feel my pain 
You can feel my torment 
Driving me insane 
I can't fight these feelings they will bring you pain 
You can't take away 
Make me whole again 

I feel betrayed 
Stuck in your ways 
And you rip me apart 
With the brutal things you say 
I can't deal with shit anymore 
I just look away 

Cause you can feel my ANGER 
You can feel my pain 
You can feel my torment 
Driving me insane 
I can't fight these feelings they bring only pain 
You can't take away 
Make me whole again

You take away 
I feel the same 
All these promises 
You promised only pain 
If you take away 
And leave me with nothing again 

'Cause you can feel my ANGER 
You can feel my pain 
You can feel my torment 
Driving me insane 
I can't fight these feelings they will bring you pain 
You can't take away 
Make me whole again 

You will feel my anger 
You will feel my pain 
You will feel my torment 
Driving you insane 
I can't fight these feelings they will bring you pain 
You won't take away 
I'll be whole again
