Ooh yeah

You can fill my cup
You can fill my bowl
This train is ready to roll
Your eyes of fire
Have stole my soul
Still coming back for more
You are the lock
I am the key
Climb up my lemon tree
You are the one
You're on your knees
You are my little queen
You know just what I mean
Climb up my lemon tree

Make me scream
All night, all night long
Gonna get extreme
All night, all night long
Make me scream
All night, all night long
Gonna get obscene
All night
All night long
All night
All night long

Pretty baby in the back of my car
Look now, you've gone too far
Have a slice of my lemon pie
One more will get you high

You wanna know
You wanna see
How much you can squeeze
You are the one
You are a tease
You love my demon seed
You know just what I mean
Climb up my lemon tree

Make me scream
All night, all night long
Gonna get extreme
All night, all night long
Make me scream
All night, all night long
Gonna get obscene
All night
All night long
All night
All night long

Suck it

You took me in the wild
No one around for miles
You ain't too proud to beg
Juice runnin' down my leg
I want a chick who makes me feel
Hmm, closer dear
I want you to be free
I want you lovin' me
I want to hear you scream
I want you just like me

Make me scream
All night, all night long
Gonna get extreme
All night, all night long
Make me scream
All night, all night long
Gonna get obscene
All night
All night long
All night
All night long

One more time now

Make me scream
All night, all night long
Gonna get extreme
All night, all night long
Make me scream
All night, all night long
Gonna get obscene
All night
All night long
All night
All night long
