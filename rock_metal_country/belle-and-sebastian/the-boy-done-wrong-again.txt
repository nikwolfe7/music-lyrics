The boy done wrong again
Hang your head in shame and cry your life away
The boy done wrong again
Hang your head in shame and cry your life away
Are you ok now?
Are you ok now?

On Saturday I was an angel shining fair
You shone louder, longer
You put my shine to shame
Put me to shame now
Put me to shame

What is it I must do to pay for all my crimes?
What is it I must do?
I would do it all the time

All I wanted was to sing the saddest songs
If somebody sings along I will be happy now

The woodland spring will put the darkness from your thinking
If this town's your sinking ship
Then you know where to jump

Talking dirty, for a hobby it's fine
So pour another glass of wine
I'll think of England this time

All I wanted was to sing the saddest songs
If somebody sings along I will be happy now
