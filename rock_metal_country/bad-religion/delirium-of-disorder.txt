Delirium of Disorder [x2]
Life is the sieve through which my anarchy strains,
Resolving itself into works.
Chaos is the score upon which reality is written,
The timeless, swirling gyroscopic horde.
Delirium
Delirium of disorder
Yeah! I am just an atom in an ectoplasmic sea
Without direction or a reason to exist.
The anechoic nebula rotating in my brain
Is persuading me, contritely, to persist.
