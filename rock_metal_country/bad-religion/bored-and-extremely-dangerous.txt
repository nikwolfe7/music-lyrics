With nothing better to do 
No one to come home to 
I woefully conclude 
To take it out on you 
I'm bored to the extreme 
This world of foolish dreams 
Disillusion 
I am not who I seem to be 
Yeah sure I might do harm 
and bear my right to arm 
Retribution 
If only someone would listen to me 
Listen to me 
Listen to me 
Listen to me 
Listen to me 

A room an empty shelf 
A book on mental health 
I look for inner wealth 
A punish in myself 
I'm bored to the extreme 
This world of foolish dreams 
Disillusion 
I am not who I seem to be 
Yeah sure I might do harm 
And bare my right to arm 
Retribution 
If only someone would listen to me 
Listen to me 
Listen to me 
Listen to me 
Listen to me
