Death and the shadow that it casts on life scares me little or none.
People tell me of a divine right and the happy chosen one.
I'm a freak 'cause my morals clash with others in the world.
I go home while they work hard, then they same I'm wrong.
There's only one place to be, while living with tragedy.
If their sins affected me, I gotta be damned to be free.
Freedom is responsibility, pay more than it's worth.
Instincts tells us not to die, hazy myth since birth.
Learn their rules, play their game, deceive yourself in haste.
Turn your own brain into dust; it's not theirs to waste.
There's only one place to be, while living with tragedy.
Extract the nectar, burn the tree, I gotta be damned to be free
Thinking... This world it ain't so bad.
Dying... It's just another fad.
Working... 8 hours, that's not for me.
Dying... It's just your destiny.
