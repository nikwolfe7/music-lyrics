Neighbors, no one loves you like he loves you,
And no one cares like he cares.
Neighbors, let us join today in the holy love of God and money,
Because neighbors, no one loves you like He loves you.
And what better way to show your love than to dig deep into your pockets.
Dig real deep, until it hurts. Alleviate your guilt,
Free yourself once again, because he gave to you, brothers and sisters.
Please give a 10, 25, or 50 dollar tax-deductible donation,
And I assure you your modest pledge will be used to censor TV and radio,
Ban questionable books, and contribute to many other Godly services.
No longer will young Christian Americans hedonistically indulge
In masochistic submission to rhythmic music, for with your monetary support,
There is no end to what we can achieve in this country.
The voice of God is government. The voice of God is government.
The voice of God is government. In God we trust, sinners repent!

Can't you see what we believe in, all our thoughts, all our reasons,
Pursuit of life and liberty and happiness we cannot see
Speak of truth with a mighty voice, but politics are your real choice.
Hire men to change the law, protect and serve with one small flaw.
Voice of God is government. The voice of God is government.
Voice of God is government. In God we trust, sinners repent!
If we shun God and Jesus Christ, religious love is sacrifice.
Love for God is shown in cash, the love they send is mailbox trash.
With every pamphlet we receive, more money asked for Godly needs.
Build a million dollar church, with money spent on God's research.
Voice of God is government. The voice of God is government.
Voice of God is government. In God we trust, sinners repent!
On late night TV, God can heal, a certain force you cannot feel.
Love for money in God's name, religion's now a TV game!
Build a million dollar church, with money spent on God's research.

Voice of God is government. The voice of God is government.
