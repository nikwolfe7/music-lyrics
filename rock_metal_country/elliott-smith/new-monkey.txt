Here come the sidewalk boss again
Telling me how I can't cave in
That I'm a study in black
Need a pat on the back
I looked up and smile
A picture of dissatisfaction
That he can only see as a junkie
Though I might be straight as an arrow
He's busy shaking hands with my monkey
Busy shaking hands with my monkey

Well I go in the car
Straight to the bar
Where my sweetie pours the beer
For the millions of fans ignoring the bands
He's in my ear
Wants me to live in denial
Says you've gotta settle for something
Though it might not be really living
Anything is better than nothing
Anything is better than nothing

No actor action man gonna move in to take my place
I'll be pumping out the product
Just a total waste

Look at your hands unoccupied
Look at the lengths you'll go to hide
You're under the veil
Pretending to fail
Gotta whole lot of empty time left to go
Now you've gotta fill it with something
I know what you can do don't you know
Anything is better than nothing

No actor action man gonna move in to take my place
I'll be pumping out the product
Just a total waste

I'm here with my cup
Afraid to look up
This is how I spend my time
Lazin' around, head hangin' down
Stuck inside my imagination
Busy making something from nothing
Pictures of hope and depression
Anything is better than nothing
Anything is better than nothing
Anything is better than nothing
Anything is better than nothing
