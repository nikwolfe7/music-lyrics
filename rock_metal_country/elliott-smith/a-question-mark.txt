i got a question mark
a got a need to always take some shoot in the dark
i don't have to make pretend the picture i'm in is totally clear
you think that all things have a way they ought to appear
'cos you know you know you know you know
you know you know you know you know you know 
i don't 
i dream
don't know what you mean
panic called you out and took you in
giving you an easy game and letting you win
you're giving back a little hatred now to the world
'cos it treated you bad
'cod you couldn't keep the great unknown from making you mad
'cos you know you know you know you know
you know you know you know you know you know
i don't
i dream
don't know what you mean
said your final word, but honesty and love could've kept us together
one day you'll see it's worth it after all
if you ever want to say you're sorry you can give me a call
