I'd say you make a perfect
Angel in the snow
All crushed out on the way you are
Better stop before it goes to far
Don't you know that I love you
Sometimes I feel like only a cold still life
That fell down here to lay beside you

Don't you know that I love you
Sometimes I feel like only a cold still life
Only a frozen still life
That fell down here to lay beside you
