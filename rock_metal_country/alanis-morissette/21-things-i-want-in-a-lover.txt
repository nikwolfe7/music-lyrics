Do you derive joy when someone else succeeds 
Do you not play dirty when engaged in competition 
Do you have a big intellectual capacity but know 
That it alone does not equate wisdom 
Do you see everything as an illusion 
But enjoy it even though you are not of it 
Are you both masculine and feminine politically aware 
And don't believe in capital punishment 

These are 21 things that I want in a lover 
Not necessarily needs but qualities that I prefer 

Do you derive joy from diving in and seeing that 
Loving someone can actually feel like freedom are you funny 
la self-deprecating like adventure and have many formed opinions

These are 21 things that I want in a lover 
Not necessarily needs but qualities that I prefer 
I figure I can describe it since I have a choice in the matter 
These are 21 things I choose to choose in a lover 

I'm in no hurry I could wait forever 
I'm in no rush cuz I like being solo 
There are no worries and certainly no pressure in the meantime 
I'll live like there's no tomorrow 

Are you uninhibited in bed more than three times a week 
Up for being experimental are you athletic 
Are you thriving in a job that helps your brother are you not addicted
...curious and communicative...
