When you meet that certain someone you been searchin' hard to find
It's a new love full of passion that can sometimes make you blind
I don't mind bein' swept away if I know right from the start
So before we go much further girl can I trust you with my heart

In the time we've spent together I have learned to trust in you
So many things you've given before I even asked you to
But reality and romance are sometimes far apart
So what I really need to know is can I trust you with my heart

Chorus:
Can I cast my cares upon you can you stand a heavy load
Can I count on you to walk me down that long and winding road
If you promise me these simple things I can guaranty
You can always count on me

Chorus

When two hearts solely surrender and are sworn to understand
It completes a perfect union between a woman and a man
So please don't misunderstand me I don't want to go too far
Without knowing just one answer can I trust you with my heart

Please girl give me just one answer can I trust you with my heart
