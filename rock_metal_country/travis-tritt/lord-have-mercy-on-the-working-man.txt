Kostas
All around I hear the sound of money
But I ain't got a nickel to my name
And everywhere I look I see temptation
She stands on every corner and calls my name

Won't you tell me if you can
Cause life's so hard to understand
Why's the rich man busy dancing
While the poor man pays the band
Oh they're billing me for killing me
Lord have mercy on the working man 

Uncle Sam's got his hands in my pockets
And he helps himself each time he needs a dime
Them politicians treat me like a mushroom
Cause they feed me bull and keep me in the blind

Repeat ChorusHey St. Peter look down for a minute
And see this little man about to drown
There's quicksand all around and man I'm in it
Please help me up Lord cause I'm going down 

Won't you tell me if you can
Cause life's so hard to understand
Why's the rich man busy dancing
While the poor man pays the band
Oh they're billing me for killing me
Lord have mercy on the working man 

Won't you tell me if you can
Cause life's so hard to understand
Why's the fat man busy dancing
While the thin man pays the band
Oh they're billing me for killing me
Lord have mercy on the working man 

Please Lord have mercy on the working man
Please Lord have mercy on the working man
