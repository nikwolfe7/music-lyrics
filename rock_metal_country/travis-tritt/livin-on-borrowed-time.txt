Yodel-a-heeeeee hoo hoo hoooo

Well I'm swimmin in debt and the money's all gone
I ain't got nothin' I can call my own
Work my fingers to the blood and bone
For a big disappointment when my paycheck comes
If I only had a little I could do just fine
I could put a down payment on some peace of mind
But I'm hangin at the end of a credit line
Lord I'm just livin' on borrowed time

My truck's financed through the Union Bank
But I don't have enough to even fill the tank
I'd take you for a ride girl but I just can't
'Cause the damned old motor won't even crank
My trailer's plenty big if we live outside
But I can't swing the payments on a double wide
You better hold a place in that welfare line
'Cause I'm just livin' on borrowed time

Yeah if it comes real cheap but don't come free
Then it stays off limits to a guy like me
They say it brings trouble havin' money to burn
I reckon that's a lesson I won't have to learnOh No

Yeah I bought my wife a little diamond ring
Her mom said ";Hon, can't even see that thing";
It'll be paid off when I'm sixty five
If I'm lucky enough to still be alive
Even if I was to up and pass away 
My family doesn't have enough to dig my grave
No tombstone just an old wood sign
Sayin He was just livin' on borrowed time
Out there hangin' from a credit line
Lord I'm just livin' on borrowed time
Lord I'm just livin' on borrowed time
