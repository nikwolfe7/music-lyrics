Years gone by - Awake again
In a glowing star - That shines so far
Lasting child - Remains inside
Playing around - A future denied
High overhead, dusk is insight...
Fumbling the mist
Lingering around...
Blow,
Carrying winds
Take me high
Where I can see
The hidden lights
That blink far beyond...
Blow,
Carrying winds
Take me high
Where I can see
The hidden lights
That blink far beyond...
And then
A painted dream
Colours that melt
Inside slender frames
There I'll stand
There I belong...
