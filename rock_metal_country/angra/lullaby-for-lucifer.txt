2:43
On the sand, by the sea
I left my heart to shed my grief
A vulture came begging me:
- Feed me with this piece of meat!
I won't give away
Something I need
On a garden nursery
I let my fancy wander free
Children playing around a tree
Sharing apples happily
Come and rest with me
Lay your hands on dreams
I'll wait here by your side
'till you fall asleep
I'll wait until you cry
All over me the tears you hide inside...
