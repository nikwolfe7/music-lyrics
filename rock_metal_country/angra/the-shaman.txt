5:23
Oh boys, I've seen the old man;
Straw mask around the forehead
The blaze, a blast and the awakening dead
The magic seeds will spread...
The bleeding warrior, he has fought
Healing leaves, piranha teeth, nobody leaves this place 'till the dawn!
Against the passion, for the love
Serpent skin, a savage scream, don't you believe, it grows and grows...
Oh boys, it's all so easy:
Warn up the soul
While the body is freezin'!...
- I swear it!
Against the men for the land,
Against the beast to survive
Against the demons to keep the faith
The spirits and the fate...
A word - together they will shout!
Run and pray if you're afraid you better stay away from it all!
A rumble shakes up all the ground
Start to sing, to turn and spin, get rid of all your sins right now!...
Oh boys, it's all so easy:
Warm up the soul
While the body is freezin'!
A word - together they will shout!
Healing leaves, piranha teeth, nobody leaves this place 'till the dawn!
Against the passion, for the love
Start to sing, to turn and spin, get rid of all your sins right now!...
Oh boys, it's all so easy:
Warm up the soul
While the body is freezin'!
Still we can hope a single word together;
Warm up the soul...
- Boys, I swear I've been there!
