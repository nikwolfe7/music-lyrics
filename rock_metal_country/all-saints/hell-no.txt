[1st verse:]
Saw you come home early this morning
Straight from somewhere you come rockin' up in a me
Later on you'll be tellin' me stories
Can you really tell me where you're coming from?
Seen your phone bill, who you been callin?
Don't try to fool me when I ask what's up
'cause boy you know me I'm too good, I know you're being phoney
Don't say another word before I mess you up

[Chorus:]
Oh now
Tell me who's that bitch I see climbing out your window
Oh, hell, no
I think I seen her face almost everywhere that we go
Oh, hell, no
Say it to my face, why hesitate, wanna know
Oh, oh, oh
Thought you'd get away boy, sorry I don't think so
Oh, hell, no

[2nd verse:]
Smell you wearing new cologne lately
Walk into the room and you be smellin' up in a me
New clothes you were never this trendy
Could never get you shopping now you shop to drop
I think ya, so stupid acting all shady
Try'na tell me lies but you be trippin up you see ya
No good at the creeping thing baby
Don't say another word before I mess you up

[Chorus:]
Oh now
Tell me who's that bitch I see climbing out your window...

[M8:]
Don't say another word before I mess you up
Why you lie
I cottoned on
Don't say another word before I mess you up

[Chorus:]
Oh now
Tell me who's that bitch I see climbing out your window...
