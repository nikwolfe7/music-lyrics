Music: Hank Shermann; Lyrics: King Diamond
Tonight the Circle is meeting again
Who will be the First to fall in Trance
In here nobody is sensing the Rain
Tonight a Spirit will glance
So as they're approaching Ghostly Hour
Seven People here are joining Hands
They think they know the Spirit to appear
Contact, the Table starts to dance
Time is standing still
It's a dangerous Meeting
They're gonna get themselves killed
Solo: M.D.
Tonight the Circle is broken Forever
Seven People dead within a Trance
In here nobody is sensing the Rain
Tonight seven Souls are reaching Hell
Time was standing still
The Meeting is over
Their Journey is on
Oh, they should have known
Not to play with the Powers of Hell
Some People have lost their Way
Some People have lost their Mind
