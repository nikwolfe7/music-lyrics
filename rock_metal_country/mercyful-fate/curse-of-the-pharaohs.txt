Away out in Egypt in the valley of kings 
Where the mummified pharaohs 
Pretend dead in their sleep 

Don't touch, never ever steal 
Unless you're in for the kill 
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs 
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you 

Now if you're breakin' the seals 
and disturbing the peace 
Then you're startin' up a curse 
Bringin' evil disease 

Don't touch, never ever steal 
Unless you're in for the kill 
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs 
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you 

The curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly 
Or just destroying your future 
Takin' it all shady 

Don't touch, never ever steal 
Unless you're in for the kill 
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
