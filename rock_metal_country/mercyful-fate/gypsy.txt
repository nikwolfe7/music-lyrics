Music: King Diamond/Michael Denner; Lyrics: King Diamond
This magic Winter Night I see a Light
Again I hear that Tune, some Sort of Croon
Oh No No No, Oh My Brain
I see them Gypsy Waggons left in the Snow
Oh I must see that Lady, I have to know
Gypsy Woman let me inside
Solo: M.D.
They say you know the Secret, Secret of Time
So gaze into your Crystal and tell me All you see
Gypsy Woman let me know
";Oh my Son you were never Gone
You are the Devil's Child, and so am I";
Solo: M.D.
Solo: H.S.
Gypsy now I know you're not my Mother
You are a Part of my Soul, it's clear for All to see
Oh No No No, I Am You
Gypsy You're Inside of Me
