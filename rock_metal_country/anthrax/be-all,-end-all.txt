Yes, no, yes, no
Not, another word
You'll know what to do
Right!
In your face they see it
In their face you...
Take it
Make up their minds
Aggression turns the screws
Fight!
Take your piece and hold it
Make your piece and...
Stand up, you know what it means
Wake up, time to live your dreams
Down by,
Law and they can't hold you
Dictate and control you
Hold onto you ideas
Down by,
Law and no one owns you
And all the shit they've  thrown you
Pay back is a real bitch
Nothing's ever easy when you  do it yourself
All you can is try
Life's not unfair, life's just life
Death not suicide
Be all, and you'll be the end all
Life can be a real ball
State of mind
Euphoria
Think,
On you feet, and stay one step ahead
Break
Take your brain and use it
Take their mind and...
Change,
An attitude, like you'd change  your shorts
Right!
In your face they see it
In their face you...
Stand up, you know what it means
Wake up, time to live your dreams
Down by,
Law and they can't see hold you
Dictate and control you
Hold onto your ideas
Down by,
Law and no one owns you
And all the shit they've  thrown you
Pay back is a real bitch
Nothing's ever easy when you do it yourself
All you can is try
Life's not unfair, life's just life
Death not suicide
Be all, and you'll be the end all
Life can be a real ball
State of mind
Euphoria
Always taking, always faking
Ignorance is so frustrating
Always taking, always faking
Ignorance is,
No way, no way, no way,  no way out!
CHORUS
