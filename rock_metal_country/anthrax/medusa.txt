Endless curse, blood runs cold
Evil stare, will turn your flesh to stone
Land of doom, world of sin
All subside, don't venture near
The island where she lives
Oh, she'll suck you in
Destroyer of life, Demon
Oh I'm ready to strike, Gorgon
Serpents bride, the end awaits
Human prey, no swords or armor
Shield you from your fate
Hey you, you can't escape
Wicked smile, full of lies
Head of snakes, approach her cave
But don't look in her eyes
Oh, her eyes
Seize, appease, deceive, die
Seize, appease, deceive, die
Medusa, she's staring at you
Medusa, with her eyes
Medusa
Evil witch, cast her spell, seducing you
She'll take you to the very depths of hell
Cannot move, no eyes to see, a statue now
For all eternity Medusa laughs at you
And you're her slave
Medusa, she's staring at you
Medusa, with her eyes
Medusa, oh, she's cold
Medusa
