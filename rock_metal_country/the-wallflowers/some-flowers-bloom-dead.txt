We didn't make it
We did not pull through
You shouldn't blame me
I don't blame you
Now what else did you think 
that I would do
ooooh as if it wasn't hard enough

I'm so tired of waking up
feeling bad
You haven't been the kind of place I have
Could it hurt you now 
to let this pass
oooooh as if it wasn't hard enough
You want to make it so much harder

Now in another world 
I could learn to forget
But 'til then I'm here 
making room for new regrets
Now some flowers they never bloom
And some flowers just bloom dead

The way you make me feel 
I could collapse
An epidemic I cannot outlast
How could you feel used 
when I feel trapped
ooooh as if it wasn't hard enough

And just as my conscience 
starts to clear
I drag the river and you're still there
The way I bring you down 
could not compare
ooooh as if it wasn't hard enough
You want to make it so much harder

Now in another world 
I could learn to forget
But 'til then I'm here 
making room for new regrets
Now some flowers they never bloom
But some flowers just bloom dead
Now some flowers they never bloom
And some flowers just bloom dead

The way I sleep 
this bed just can't be made
I pull the covers up around my head
Now when I think of me
I think of somebody else instead
As if it wasn't hard enough
You're gonna make it so much harder

Now in another world 
I could learn to forget
But 'til then I'm here 
making room for new regrets
Now some flowers they never bloom
And some flowers just bloom dead
Now some flowers they never bloom
And some flowers they just bloom dead
