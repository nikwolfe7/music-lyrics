All's well at the midnight hour
You're ready to fly
Don't think about the darkness
Or the rumbling in the sky
Somewhere on the morning road
Just waiting for you
Somethings that just could never be
Are calling up a spell so you can see, yeah!
Dream evil
The dark that you find in the back of your mind
Dream evil - Dream evil
Don't go to the edge of rainbows
Don't close your eyes
Like things that can't be real
The truth is really lies
Don't wish on a rising star you should
Open up the door
Where things that just should never be
Are calling up a spell so you can see, yeah!
Dream evil
The dark that you find
Can come out of your mind
Dream evil
Take you away
Oh no it's the midnight hour
Don't leave me alone
Those things that just should never be
Are calling up a spell so you can see
Dream evil
Dream evil
Dream evil
Dream evil
Dream evil
Oh no it's the midnight hour
Don't open the door
Don't go to the edge of rainbows
Don't sleep any more
You'll dream evil
You'll dream evil
You'll dream evil
Dream evil
