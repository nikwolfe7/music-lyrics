Close your eyes, make a wish
That this could last forever
If only you could stay with me now
So tell me what it is
That keeps us from each other now
Yeah it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss you

Take my hand, take my life
Just don't take forever
And let me feel your pain kept inside oh yeah
There's gotta be a way
For you and I together now
Yeah it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss ohh
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss you

It's an illusion
How can I feel this way?
If I can't have you
It's an illusion
Nothing is real this way
If I can't have you

No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now now
Caught by the taste of your kiss I don't wanna know
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this I'm climbing the walls
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss

Ohhhh
I can't let you go no

And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this ohh ohh
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss I miss you
