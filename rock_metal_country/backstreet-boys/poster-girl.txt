Yeah yeah yeah

Julie was a long way from home
She could make alone look pretty
Her attitude made a part of the landscape
Riding her bike through Alphabet City
She likes to party in the backseat
Under the bridge on the Brooklyn side
Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow
Taking bets that the sun won't rise

She said, "what good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"
She can lick her lips and smile
And make you wannabelieve

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

Right now right now
Oooh
Oh ohh

Julie liked to shoplift in stores
Ride alongside the rich and famous
Get in elevators, press emergency stop
And make love on the floor 'til the camera made us
And no woman in the world ever made me feel like my heart's on fire
Where she'd walk I followed followed
When she left I cried

What good is tomorrow without a guarantee?
I was wrapped around her finger
And I began to believe

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

La la la la
La la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la

Oh
Tell me what you want from me
I've got everything you need
It's getting hard for me to breathe
Let me be your guarantee

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

That the consequences poster girl of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

Right now right now
Right now ohhh ohh
