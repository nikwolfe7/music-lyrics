Oh no
Take what you need 'cause I can't hold my breath
Say what you feel 'cause I got nothing left, oh
I made a promise to myself last night
I'm gonna keep it if it's wrong or right

And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, if I lose it all
Wouldn't matter anyway

Don't change a thing, perfect as you are
Time has a way, time is all I've got
If my heart should shatter watching you
That'd be one less thing I'd have to prove

And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, if I lose it all

Heaven will be waiting when I fall into your open arms
I believe you'll find me there
You'll find me there

And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, if I lose it all

And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, if I lose it all
Wouldn't matter anyway
