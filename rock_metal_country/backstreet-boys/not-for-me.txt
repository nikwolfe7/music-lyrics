I was looking for something
On the crime scene where you're in too deep
I found a note with this number
It's just another clueit leads to you
I got a little suspicious, I got a feeling
That you ain't true to me
I should have known better than to buy your lies

You can fool anyone but I got eyes to see
That you're not for me, babe

No No Uh uh
Things will never be the same again with you
No No Uh uh
Now I know what it's coming to
No No Uh uh
Cause if you think that it's the way that love, should be
Let me tell you it's not for me

I don't want to be on, your screenplay
Just tell me did you rehearse on me
I'll give you the story
Baby who screwed who Me or him
Caught in the middle
And I'm tired of your games of Hide and Seek
I'm getting the feeling that it's time for me to leave

You can fool anyone but I got eyes to see
That you're not for me, baby

And it won't go away won't go away
