All these dirty words
Jusqu'a la fin 
They make us look so dumb
En plein soleil
Been drinking far too much
Jusqu'a la fin
And neither of us mean what we say 
En plein amour

Well you and I 
Collapsed in love 
And it looks like we might have made it, yes 
It looks like we've made it to the end 

What happened to us 
Jusqu'a la fin 
Soon it will be gone forever
En plein soleil 
Infatuated only with ourselves 
Jusqu'a la fin
And neither of us can think straight anymore 
En plein amour

Well you and I 
Collapsed in love 
And it looks like we might have made it, yes
It looks like we've made it to the end
When you and I 
Collapsed in love 
Well it looks like we might have made it, yes
It looks like we've made it to the end 

En plein amour
You and I
We just collapsed in love 
Collapsed in love 
And it looks like we might have made it, yes
It looks like we've made it to the end

En plein soleil
En plein soleil
