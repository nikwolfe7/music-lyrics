Oh, well lesson dance
And shoot to god
A storm-suffered owl
You're not invisible inside your car
No matter what stupid sort of mission you're on
Well, you're not invisible inside your car

I go absolutely mental
Good ramblin' George
Well, you're not invisible inside your car
No matter, you could breathe it like your flies in a jar
Yeah, you're not invisible

I like the sailing teeming
Well, it's true that the moon could pull it back and far away from me
I should just let it be
Well, it's true that the moon could pull it back and far away from me
And it's sad

Oh, we had to have some kind
Room shaped like a charm
Well, you weren't invisible
Not all along
No matter how many eagles came in the door
We were not invisible
I knew that

I like the sailing teeming 
Well, it's true that the moon could pull it back and far away from me
And there's the orphan sea
We were never invisible but that I guess we did not see

Of course this all had been laid down
Way before we lay down for it all
Before we had a course, of course
Of course this all had been laid down

Of course we lay down..
Of course we lay down..
Of course we lay down..
Of course we lay down..
Of course we lay down..
Of course we lay down....

I like the sailing teeming
Well, it's true that the moon could pull it back and far away from me
I like the orphan sea
Well, we were never invisible but that I guess we could not see

We'll get crushed by the ocean
But it will not get us wet
Crushed by the ocean
But it will not get us wet
Crushed by the ocean
But it will not get us wet
Crushed by the ocean
But it will not get us wet
