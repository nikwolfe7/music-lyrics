There's a double standard for the way we live
If there's nothing to have, well then there's nothing to save
I'll break a sweat and I don't regret
What you'd kill to see brings out the god in me.
Come and be with me
Live my twisted dream
Pro devoted sledge
Time for primal concrete sledge
The man of a thousand retirements
Will always be the one to tell you when to quit
I won't take stock in a withered man
I'm reaching into you, I'll make you understand
Come and be with me
Live my twisted dream
Pro devoted sledge
Time for primal concrete sledge
