Scrape it, grind it, peel it, hide it
The trend is over and gone forever
Shelf it, box it, save it, frame it
You won't need that anymore, it's on sale at the dollar store
Waste of time, pantomime, circus doll, at the local mall
Exterminate, it's all fake!
Exterminate, it's all fake
Sandblast yourself
Sandblast yourself
Sandblast
Sandblast
It's getting old, old, old
