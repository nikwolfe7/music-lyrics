If you want me 
You can find me 
Left of center 
Off of the strip 

In the outskirts 
In the fringes 
In the corner 
Out of the grip 

When they ask me 
"What are you looking at?" 
I always answer 
"Nothing much" not much 
I think they know that 
I'm looking at them 
I think they think 
I must be out of touch 

But I'm only 
In the outskirts 
And in the fringes 
On the edge 
And off the avenue 
And if you want me 
You can find me 
Left of center 
Wondering about you 

I think that somehow 
Somewhere inside of us 
We must be similar 
If not the same 
So I continue 
To be wanting you 
Left of center 
Against the grain 

If you want me 
You can find me 
Left of center 
Off of the strip 
In the outskirts 
In the fringes 
In the corner 
Out of the grip 

When they ask me 
"What are you looking at?" 
I always answer 
"Nothing much" not much 
I think they know that 
I'm looking at them 
I think they think 
I must be out of touch 

But I'm only 
In the outskirts 
And in the fringes 
On the edge 
And off the avenue 
And if you want me 
You can find me 
Left of center 
Wondering about you 
Wondering about you
