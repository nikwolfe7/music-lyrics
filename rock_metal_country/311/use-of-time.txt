With the words staying me slow
The verbs that just don't flow
Confusing use of time
Partial stoning of the heart
Waiting for something to start
Confusing use of time

But the trying again
Makes me think it's all gonna end
Confusing use of time

But everytime I turn the volume down
All the I hear is the deafening sound
Of you hearts pound

But the trying again
Makes me think it's all gonna end
Confusing use of time

Today, the longest day
Hearing repeating things you'd say
Confusing use of time
Can you hear the void I describe
What could I say vacancy sounds like
Confusing use of time

But the trying again
Makes me think it's all gonna end
Confusing use of time
