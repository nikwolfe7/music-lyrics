This old man I've talked about
Broke his own heart,
Poured it in the ground.
Big red tree grew up and out,
Throw up its leaves,
Spins round and round.
I know all this and more.
So take your hat off
When you're talking to me
And be there when I feed the tree.
This little squirrel I used to be
Slammed her bike down the stairs.
They put silver where her teeth had been.
Baby silvertooth,she grins and grins.
I know all this and more.
So take your hat off boy
When you're talking to me
And be there when I feed the tree.
Take your hat off boy
When you're talking to me
And be there when I feed the tree.
This old man I used to be
Spins around, around, around the tree.
Silver baby come to me.
I'll only hurt you in my dreams.
I know all this and...
I know all this and...
I know all this and more.
So take your hat off boy
When you're talking to me
And be there when I feed the tree.
Take your hat off
When you're talking to me
