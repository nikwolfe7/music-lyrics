Out on the street I'm stalking the night 
I can hear my heavy breathing 
Paid for the kill but it doesn't seem right 
Something there I can't believe in 
Voices are calling from inside my head 
I can hear them I can hear them 
Vanishing memories of things that were said 
They can't try to hurt me now 

But a shot in the dark one step away from you 
A shot in the dark always creeping up on you 

Taught by the powers that preach over me 
I can hear their empty reason 
I wouldn't listen I learned how to fight 
I opened up my mind to treason 

But a shot in the dark one step away from you 
A shot in the dark always creeping up on you 

Taught by the powers that preach over me 
I can hear their empty reason 
I wouldn't listen I learned how to fight 
I opened up my mind to treason 

But just like the wounded and when it's too late 
They'll remember they'll surrender 
Never a care for that people who hate 
Underestimate me now 

But a shot in the dark one step away from you 
A shot in the dark not a thing that you can do 
A shot in the dark always creeping up on you 

But just like the wounded and when it's too late 
They'll remember they'll surrender 
Never a care for the people who hate 
Underestimate me now 

But a shot in the dark one step away from you 
A shot in the dark not a thing that you can do 
A shot in the dark always creeping up on you
