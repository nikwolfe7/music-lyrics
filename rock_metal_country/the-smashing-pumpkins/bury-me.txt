Bury me in love
Bury me in love 

Shared your kisses, take your heart
Buried me and it hurts

I love my sister so
She don't smother me
I played the spades I know
I'm a jack of all trades
Would you bury me

Once you see her
One inside hide, hide
Some things you just can't hide
If you see her
Tell me why why, why
Why won't she come outside

Once you see her
One inside hide, hide
Some things you just can't hide
If you see her
Tell me why why, why
Why won't she come outside

She will bury me
She will bury me
