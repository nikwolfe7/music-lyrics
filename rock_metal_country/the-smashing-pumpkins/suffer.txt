All that you suffer is all that you are
All that you smother is all that you are
And you're saying you're seeing, you're saying who you are
What takes meaning is cleaning the meaning of who you are 

All may say
I will dream
All may say

All your struggles beneath your disguise
Drink from the reasons that hold you alive
'Til we're safe from the wounds of desire and pain
You must rise from the mounds of desire and change

Too late to discover peace of mind
Too late to recover me

All you see and all you breathe and all you cease to be
Taken down your only son and what he means to me
Your dream will be
To dream with me

Will you wait Yes I will, I will wait for you
To cleanse your life takes more than time
Take what you want
Take all of it

Too late to discover peace of mind have no peace of mind
Too late to recover
