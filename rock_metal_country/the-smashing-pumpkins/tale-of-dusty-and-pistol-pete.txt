Dusty screams, through doors and imaginary floors 
"Why can't you miss me" 
Pistol pete removes the final breaths from her unkind and she is shaken 
What does this mean in love or in peace 
With you lying next to me 
So faithless serene 
And she calls to him 

Let the waste cross the ancient trails to you 
Far out beneath the sorrow clouds 
Let them taste the bitter lost mistake of you 
Let them cry out through your rusted scars 

Alone he roams inside the ordinary catacombs of her waiting 
With raven hands she steals and staggers towards her man 
Still scorned by his demon 

Because he's undone 
Become the language of 
Disaster and love, vengeance and dust 
And she calls to him 

Let the waste cross the ancient trails to you 
Far out beneath the sorrow clouds 
Let them taste the bitter lost mistake of you 
Let them cry out through your rusted scars 

Dusty screams, through doors and imaginary scenes 
Of hurt and teardrop 
As he holds her down, in the cold lonely winds 
Together again, her inside him 
And she calls to him 

Let the waste cross the ancient trails to you 
Far out beneath the sorrow clouds 
Let them taste the bitter lost mistake of you 
Let them cry out through your rusted scars
