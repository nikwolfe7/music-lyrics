Kiss and kill me sweetly 
Come and drive me home 
Drag the miles in me 
I am yours alone 

Inside where it's warm 
Wrap myself in you 
Outside where I'm torn 
Fight myself in two 
In two 
Into you 

Desire me so deeply 
Drain and kick me hard 
Whisper secrets for me 
Try to go too far 

Inside where it's warm 
Wrap myself in you 
Outside where I'm torn 
Fight myself in two 
In two 
Into... 

Please don't change 
Please don't change at all 
Bring your rain 
Bring your rain to fall 

Inside where it's warm 
Wrap myself in you 
Outside where I'm torn 
Fight myself in two 
In two 
Into you 

Come and kiss me sweetly 
Ride the telephone 
Drag the miles to me 
I am yours alone 
Yours alone 
On the telephone 
Yours alone 
Looking for a kiss kiss 
Yours alone
