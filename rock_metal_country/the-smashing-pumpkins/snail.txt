All your seven dreams
Look close, son, and you'll believe
As your things come undone
See you are the only one 

Flower, seize the hour I did
I wait Waiting, waiting for your wake
I'll wait

When you wake up you're all weak
Throwing your life away
Someday, sorry coming home
Sorry snail
What you wait for

Flower, the pain will wash away, away
When the sun shines
Climbs through your window into your bed

When you wake up you're all weak
Throwing your life away
Someday, sorry coming home
Sorry snail
Down in my heart

Flower save the hours
Flower away

What you wait for
Flower chase the sunshine
Flower chase the sunshine
Flower
