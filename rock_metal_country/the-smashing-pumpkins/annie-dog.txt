Amphetamine annie-dog 
Has her leash and a face 
Her velvet spleen her shackle spine 
Her dimond curse 
It comes with mine 

A vessel she 
For violent I 
Confession arms a wake 
Mine, mine you were always mine 
Possessed by my taste 

And below the angel dog 
Combs her hair and sings her psalms 
The bombs go off 
She doesn't notice 
It all goes wrong 
She sets things tragic 
She is venus 
She is mars 
She's electric 
And the struggle of 

Upon my face we leave no trace 
But in her stomach mercury aged 

She holds the blood 
She carves the knives 
She digs the wives in our babies 

Amphetamine annie-dog 
Pulls her trash 
And her stories 
From place to place 
And bed to bed 
Gives of herself and the magnet head 

Another floor another ceiling 
Counting stairs with double meanings 

Is it wrong to be swallowed whole 
To disappear in her 
To give her the priceless peace 
Of giving up control 

We tumble out into the streets 
And annie-dog she drags her leash 
Pretty face 
Ugly mouth 
Bitter bred and so released 

And by the no 
And by the yes 
Annie goes if you couldn't guess 

A simple man 
A sycophant 
Her elephant with the laughing call 
She wants clean sheets 
And fresh flowers 
And dental shots 
And the hong kong glue 

Amphetamine annie-dog 
Has her leash and a face
