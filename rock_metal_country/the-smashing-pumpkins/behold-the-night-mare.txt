I've faced the fathoms in your deep 
Withstood the suitors quiet siege 
Pulled down the heavens just to please you 
Appease you 
The wind blows and I know 

I can't go on, digging roses from you grave 
To linger on, beyond the beyond 
Where the willows weep 
And whirlpools sleep, you'll find me 
The coarse tide reflects sky 

And the night mare rides on, and the night mare rides on 
With a december black psalm 
And the night mare rides on 
What i fear is lost here 
The wind blows and I know 

All you have to do is run away 
And steal yourself from me 
Become a mystery to gaze into 
You're so cruel in all you do 
But still I believe, I believe in you 

So may you come with your own knives 
You'll never take me alive 
With all the force of what is true 
Is there nothing I can do 

I can't go on, digging roses from you grave 
To linger on, beyond the beyond 
Where the willows weep 
And whirlpools sleep, you'll find me 

And the night mare rides on, and the night mare rides on 
With a december black psalm 
And the night mare rides on 

I've faced the fathoms in your deep 
Withstood the suitors quiet siege 
Pulled down the heavens just to please you 
To hold the flower I can't keep
