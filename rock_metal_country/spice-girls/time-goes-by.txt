I've never had a feeling so right
Like I have with you
Can't explain the things you do
But boy when you
Tell me softly you love me too

It's like I know we were meant to be
So for eternity
You will have a part of me
And all I need
Is for you to stay right here with me, yeah

Time goes by but we stand still know it does, I know it does
Love you for eternity, I will I will
I know that we were meant to be we were meant to be, my love
That's how I feel when you're with me

You are the reason that my heart beats
And no, I never thought I would ever fall so deep
But now I see
That the love that we share
Is oh-so-sweet

What if I told you that I believe believe
That you were my soul, my destiny my destiny, yeah
What if I was to say
In every way
Deep in my heart is where you'll be time

Time goes by but we stand still I'm still right here
Love you for eternity, I will I'll never go
I know that we were meant to be we were meant to be
That's how I feel when you're with me how I feel, when you're with me

Time goes by but we stand still oh time, oh time
Love you for eternity, I will eternity I will
I know that we were meant to be we were meant, baby love
That's how I feel when you're with me

As you hold me close, so tenderly
And watch you fall to sleep

Who now completes
The half of me I used to be me I used to be
