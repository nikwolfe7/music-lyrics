I'm steppin' out into the walk of life
Hold tight the vibe is right
Feel the heat that's in the air 
People watchin' everywhere 

Rush hour slow it down
Stop and listen to the summer sound
Playing in the park and street talkin' 
London Town is walkin', walkin' 

London Town is walkin' I said it's really talkin', yeah
Steppin' in the walk of life
I said, makin' out the walk of life
London Town I'm stalkin'
I said I'm really walkin', yeah 

The sun goes down and the lights come up
So we move on to a club
Surround yourself with the feel-good groove 
People dancin' everywhere 

Make your move go, turn it up
Rockin' rhythm at the rasta club
Singin' in the dark and heart thumpin' 
London Town is thumpin'
I said it was jumpin' 

London Town is walkin'
I said it's really talkin', yeah
Steppin' in the walk of life
I said, makin' out the walk of life
London Town I'm stalkin'
I said I'm really walkin', yeah 

Zing zinga zinga zing zinga zinga
Zing zing zinga zinga zinga zinga
Zinga zaaaaahhhhh 
Zing zinga zinga zing zaaaaahhhhh
Zing zaaahhhh ha ahhh 

The sun is risin' but we haven't slept
I'm not ready to rest my head yet
Huddle close till you get no air
See the crew down Leicester Square 

Night-crawlers morning dew
People watchin' - is it you? 
Jump the bus and fell hoppin'
London Town is still buzzin' 
Oh it's really buzzin', yeah 

London Town is walkin'
I said it's really talkin', yeah
Steppin' in the walk of life
I said, makin' out the walk of life
London Town I'm stalkin'
I said I'm really walkin', yeah
