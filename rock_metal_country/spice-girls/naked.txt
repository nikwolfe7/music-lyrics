Naivety and childhood left behind deprived of the goodness of mankind, 
past encounters have made her strong, strong enough to carry on and on, 
Undress you with her eyes, uncover the truth from the lies, 
Strip you down don't need to care, lights are low exposed and bare 
Naked 
Nothing but a smile upon her face 
Naked 
She wants to play seek and hide, no-one to hide behind 
Naked 
This child has fallen from grace 
Naked 
Don't be afraid to stare she is only naked 
She knows exactly what to do with men like you, 
Inside out in her mind there's no doubt where you're coming from 
mystery will turn you on. 
Undress you with her eyes, uncover the truth from the lies, 
Strip you down don't need to care, lights are low exposed and bare 
Naked 
Nothing but a smile upon her face 
Naked 
She wants to play seek and hide, no-one to hide behind 
Naked 
This child has fallen from grace 
Naked 
Don't be afraid to stare she is only naked 
A conversation between Emma and the mystery man 
Hello, its me 
I thought you'd understand 
Well maybe I should have kept my mouth shut 
I keep seeing such a pretty picture 
I'd rather be hated than pitied 
Maybe I should have left it to your imagination 
I just want to be me 
This angel's dirty face is sore, holding on to what she had before. 
Not sharing secrets with any old fool, now she's gonna keep her cool 
She wants to get naked 
She wants to get naked 
Naked 
Nothing but a smile upon her face 
Naked 
She wants to play seek and hide, no-one to hide behind 
Naked 
This child has fallen from grace 
Naked 
Don't be afraid to stare she is only naked
