Crack and break, life's big mistake,
I'm feeling it too, there's no way home.
The summer's gone,
The summer's gone away.

Back down to earth, a conscience burst,
I'm feeling it too, just slipped away.
The summer's gone,
The love has gone,
The sun has gone away,
Away

[Chorus:]
It's turned to grey, just burned away,
A moment too soon, we've turned to grey...
Just like yesterday,
It's turned to black and white.

Cold as stone, no contact known
You're feeling it too, as thoughts decay.
The summer's gone, the colour's gone,
The sun has gone away

[Chorus]

Oh, you're thinking back, you're going back to places that you've been,
Where days could last forever, but you can only dream,
Oh, we're going back I'm looking back to places that we've seen,
Moments that have been, places we can dream.

Crash and break, life's big mistake,
You're feeling it too, just slipped away.
The love has gone, 
The summer's gone away.

[Chorus x2]
