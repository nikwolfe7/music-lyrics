Ponders, Yet you're undecided I sprinkle looks to let you know Pain is a wave, Come on let's ride it Jump on now, Or We'll have to row Now, while your eyes run back The memories attack I'll give you my last crack The dreams keep me awake Feelings seem hard to shake Same way I always fake Dripping off, you come to meet me Break off a piece, to let you know And they bubble all around you Yeah there's a love But it won't show And while your eyes run back The memories attack I'll give you one last crack The dreams keep me awake Feelings seem hard to shake Same way I always flake Need a way to keep it simple All the times I bailed, you float Girl you reachin for your anchor I turned it down Right down your throat
