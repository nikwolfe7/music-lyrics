Drivin hard through your friend Gotta find a way to mend The less we see, the more it grows Festering out of control Piled High You get that face, I wonder why we ever got it together What's to say Just no clue, we just know what to do Hope it comes together It's the norm, float again It's the stuff you said you send Take it in, Wait to see If its enough, just 'cause it's free Push too far Feel the skin begin to scar Can't really put it together Now it's a drag With no hope of coming back How can you ever get it together? 
[Solo] Bottled up, stored away Always ready to give way Push it farther, yeah we know Clinging, hoping it won't show Piled High You get that face, I wonder why we ever got it together Push too far Feel the skin begin to scar Can't really pull it together About to crack With no hope of coming back How can you ever get it together What's to say Just no clue, we just know what we do Hope it comes together
