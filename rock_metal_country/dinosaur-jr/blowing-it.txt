I been thinking through the night Everybody's so uptight People hurt and that's their right Cut 'em all loose, think I might Stewin', hangin' out in town And my head whirlin' around Don't trust your mind, it'll let you down Don't have a thing to go on I don't know a thing to say to you I don't know a thing to say to you There's a time and there's a place It's not now, it's time to pace Things I'd say but just can't face All it means to say them I could believe the things I feel Then tomorrow get the same deal Am I acting on something real? Or am I blowing it again? I don't know a thing to say to you I don't know a thing to say to you I don't know a thing to say to you I don't know a thing to say to you
