In the morning It's the last time that I saw her face In that special way to me Without a warnin' She pulled every trick to name a few What was I supposed to be ? I'd like to think she cried for me But I don't know Her memories won't let me be Just can't let go In the morning Is when I think about her Could it be she cried for me ? I don't think so In the evening I don't think it was a peaceful scene Seemed to me a little rough She was leavin' But she forgot to leave a piece of me I didn't know she was that tough I don't know why she'd see me I don't know what else to be I'd like to think she cried for me But I don't know Her memories won't let me be Just can't let go In the morning Is when I think about her Could it be she cried for me ? I don't think so [Solo] 
Is there something That I could do to make her feel a thing ? I don't know what to expect Guess there's one thing I got left but then I could be wrong Maybe that's the thing she wrecked I don't know why she'd see me I don't know what else to be Hope she's diggin' being free But does she cry for me ? I don't know Her memories won't let me be Just can't let go But in the morning Is when I think about her Could it be she cried for me ? I don't know I'd like to think she cried for me I don't think so
