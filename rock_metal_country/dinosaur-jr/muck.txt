I know these things have passed you by I know it's tough to even try It's such a different kind of scene I know you don't know what I mean Yeah well, I tried to tell you before I know all you want is more I'll always tell you different stuff No matter what won't be enough I figure it'll be cool sometime After I've cooked everyone I find I can only take it to that certain place It's just not cool, look at your face Whenever you get in my face There's something strange I start to taste Hold back, hold back, hold back Hold back, hold back, hold back It's all restrain I'm gettin' these days Is it okay or am I out of place So everytime you see me now You psyche for a minute Till you remember how I crawl here inside In mind with muck You stopped smiling Remember how everything sucked Dancing around what I could say Cause I just can't live that way Hold back, that's not enough to stay Hold back, hold back, hold back Hold back, hold back, hold back Hold back, hold back, hold back Hold back, hold back, hold back
