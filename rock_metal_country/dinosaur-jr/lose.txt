Can't believe a single word I've said 
And every subject's the only one that's dead 
And there's nothing from my side 
Just yourself 
You'll split 
I'll began 
'Bout to fight 
Greatest stories pass, in my mind 
Must be a better way to pass my time 
To think the focus just belongs to me 
Selfish man, I know I'm nothing to me 
So when I thought I had more to say 
Swimmin' in my head 
Chained to this corpse 
For one more day 
Little lies start around 
Not a show, feel so down 
And I struggle right inside out 
Reach the wall, spiral down 
Retchedness 
I'm hardly standing still 
I'll be there 
Sometimes thinking right 
I can't believe I was chosen to exist 
'Cause only Jesus Christ can slit his wrists, he says 
So though we kill this need to always understand 
Cut the world and tell me it fits on the back of your hand
