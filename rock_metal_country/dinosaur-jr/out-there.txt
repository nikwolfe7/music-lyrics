I know your name I know the people out there feel the same I know you're gone I hope you got some friends to come along I know you're out there I know you're gone You can't say that's fair Can't you be wrong? I feel ok Sure, I know that's not what people say Maybe they're wrong Maybe you weren't on my side all along I know you're out there I know you're gone You can't say that's fair Can't you be wrong? I know you're out there You're still a case It's still the place Weren't you invited? It's what you can't spare Whatever's left, just hide the rest And bring it right in I know it's sick I know you think a game is just a trick Maybe I've changed Just tell me was this all in vain? [Solo] I know you're out there I know that space is not a race Weren't you invited? It's what you can't spare Whatever's left, just hide the rest And bring it right in Maintained inside I've lost my range Feel the strain Weren't you invited? Just never try It's still the place You're still the case Now bring it right in
