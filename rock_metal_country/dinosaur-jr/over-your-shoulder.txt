Hey, look over your shoulder Hey, as we're gettin' older Always thought I should've told you It's alright, but it's sure gettin' colder I know you're over my shoulder I know now you'll get to hold her You're gone But it can't be wrong You're gone Can't be for long You walked over my shoulder You came cause I told you You thought I knew it was over All you knew was to hold her You're gone It can't be wrong You're gone Don't stay for long [Solo] You figure this, you don't get to be I'm wrong, whatever it's still the same I know it's over your shoulder I know now you'll get to hold her When I wake up And you are gone When I wake up I knew all along When I wake up And you are gone When I wake up I knew all along [Solo] You're gone But it can't be wrong You're gone Don't stay too long You're gone But it can't be wrong You're gone Can't be for long
