And when the sun, it turns to snow 
And the grass doesn't grow 
Don't laugh, I love you 
I could look outside my window every day 
But you wouldn't be there to there come and play 
Don't laugh, I love you 

Ernest Hemingway Ernest Hemingway 
Would always be there for me Would always be there for me 
But now Ernest Hemingway Ernest Hemingway is dead is dead now 

If I could get you back someday 
Don't you say you're going away 
Don't laugh, I love you 
And if you locked me in the sun 
To the tinkle I would run 
Don't laugh, I love you 

Nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu 
Nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu 
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you 
Don't laugh, I love you 
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
