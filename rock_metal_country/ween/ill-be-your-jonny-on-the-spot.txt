I'll be your jonny on the spot, I'll be your jonny on the spot 
My daddy died, left me all he's got, I'll be your jonny on the spot 

I get up early in the morn, I get up early in the morn 
I slop the pigs, Momma shucks the corn, I get up early in the morn 

I got a Chevy with a Mopar cam, I got a Chevy with a Mopar cam 
I got a Chevy with a-Mopar-cam, I'll be your jonny on the spot 

I'm goin' down, I'm goin' down, I'm goin' down, I'm goin' down 
I'm goin' down, I'm goin' down, I'll be your jonny on the spot 

[Repeat first verse]
