Don't quiver little boy, your daddy's with you now 
It won't be long anyhow 
It's just around the corner 
The destiny that I embrace with you 

Don't get too close to my fantasy 
Don't be afraid to clutch the hand of your creator 
Stare into the lion's eyes and if you taste the candy 
You'll get to the surprise 

Stay calm little dreamer and drift off into dreams 
The gentle kiss of night is better than it seems 
It's just around the corner 
Close your eyes and soon you'll be with me 

Don't get too close to my fantasy 
Don't be afraid to clutch the hand of your creator 
Stare into the lion's eyes and if you taste the candy 
You'll get to the surprise [3x]
