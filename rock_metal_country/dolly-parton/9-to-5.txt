Tumble outta bed 
And stumble to the kitchen 
Pour myself a cup of ambition 
Yawnin', stretchin', try to come to life 
Jump in the shower 
And the blood starts pumpin' 
Out on the streets 
The traffic starts jumpin' 
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5 
Chorus: 
Workin' 9 to 5 
What a way to make a livin' 
Barely gettin' by 
It's all takin' 
And no givin' 
They just use your mind 
And they never give you credit 
It's enough to drive you 
Crazy if you let it 
9 to 5, for service and devotion 
You would think that I 
Would deserve a fair promotion 
Want to move ahead 
But the boss won't seem to let me in 
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me 
Mmmmm... 
They let your dream 
Just a' watch 'em shatter 
You're just a step 
On the boss man's a' ladder 
But you got dream he'll never take away 
On the same boat 
With a lot of your friends 
Waitin' for the day 
Your ship'll come in 
And the tide's gonna turn 
An' it's all gonna roll you away 
2nd Chorus: 
Workin' 9 to 5 
What a way to make a livin' 
Barely gettin' by 
It's all takin' 
And no givin' 
They just use your mind 
And you never get the credit 
It's enough to drive you 
Crazy if you let it 
9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you 
There's a better life 
And you think that I would daunt you 
It's a rich man's game 
No matter what they call it 
And you spend your life 
Going funny if you want it 
3rd Chorus: 
Workin' 9 to 5 
What a way to make a livin' 
Barely gettin' by 
It's all takin' 
And no givin' 
They just use you mind 
And they never give you credit 
It's enough to drive you 
Crazy if you let it 
Fade: 
9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you 
There's a better life 
And you dream that I would daunt you 
It's a rich man's game 
No matter what they call it 
And you spend your life 
Going funny if you want it
