Sittin' on the front porch on a summer afternoon 
In a straightback chair on two legs, leans against the wall 
Watch the kids a' playin' with June bugs on a string 
And chase the glowin' fireflies when evenin' shadows fall 
Chorus: 
In my Tennessee mountain home 
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh 
In my Tennessee mountain home 
Crickets sing in the fields near by 
Honeysuckle vine clings to the fence along the lane 
Their fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet 
And on a distant hilltop, an eagle spreads it's wings 
An' a songbird on a fence post sings a melody 
Repeat Chorus 
Walkin' home from church on a Sunday with the one ya' love 
Just laughin', talkin', making future plans 
And when the folks ain't lookin', you might steal a kiss or two 
Sittin' in the porch swing, holdin' hands 
Repeat Chorus
