Chorus: 
Two doors down 
They're laughing and drinkin', and having a party 
Two doors down 
They're not aware that I'm around 
Cause here I am 
Crying my heart out, feelin' sorry while 
They're having a party two doors down 
I think I'll dry these useless tears 
And get myself together 
I think I'll wonder down the hall 
And have a look around 
'Cause I can't stay inside 
This lonely room and cry forever 
I think I really rather join 'em 
Two door down, yeah 
Repeat Chorus 
'Cause here I am 
No longer cryin' an' feelin' sorry 
We're having a party just two doors down 
I can't believe I'm standin' here 
Dry-eyed, all smiles and talkin' 
Making conversation with the new love I have found 
I ask him if he'd like to be alone and we start walkin' 
Down the hall to my place waitin' two doors down, yeah 
Repeat Chorus 
'Cause here I am 
Feelin' everything but sorry 
We're having our own party two doors down 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Two doors down 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Two doors down 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Two doors down 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Two doors down, oh 
Repeat Chorus 
'Cause here we am 
Feelin' everything but sorry 
We're havin' our own party 
Two doors down, yeah 
Fade:
