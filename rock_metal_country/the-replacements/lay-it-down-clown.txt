Got a big switchblade, drop drop bill a tease
There's a deal goin' down, it don't go down around me

Rumors keep on spreadin' all over town             
Lay it down clown, lay it down
Lay it down clown, lay it down

Spirit is willing and you think you got what it takes  
The only exercise you ever get is the shakes             

Rumors keep on spreadin' all over town      
Lay it down clown, lay it down              
Lay it down clown, lay it down

Get back to the hills, get back to back where you belong
Finally found out which way the wind blows

The rumors keep on spreadin' all over town
Lay it down clown, lay it down
Lay it down clown, lay it down
Lay it down clown, lay it down               
Lay it down clown, lay it down
