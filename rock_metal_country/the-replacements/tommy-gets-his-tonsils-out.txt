Tommy gets his tonsils out
Hi Susie, do you know what?
I've been in the hospital...

Now open wide, the doctor's here
Everything is fine, got nothing to fear
Strap 'em down, we're outta gas
Stop your bawling, you little brat

Let's get this over with, I'm off in a hour
Didn't wash up, yesterday I took a shower
Get this over with, I tee off in an hour
My Cadillac's running

Let's..
Rip, rip, we're gonna rip 'em out now
Rip, rip, we're gonna rip 'em out now
Rip, rip, we're gonna rip 'em out now
Rip, rip, we're gonna rip 'em out nowOpen wide, you little snot
That's the way we knock em out
Got nothing to fear
Got nothing to be afraid of
Doctor's here, nothing to be afraid of

Let's get this over, we have to tee off in an hour
Did I wash up?
Yesterday, I took myself a shower
My Cadillac's running

How ya doin?
How do you feel after the operation?
Can I come by?
I'm really feeling terrible
