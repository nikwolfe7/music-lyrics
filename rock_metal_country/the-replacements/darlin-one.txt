The smell of man that now scents your wings
and with that, brings a change in things
Banished forever from the sacred nest
On your snow-white breast  
I feel there's still unrest

I said, hey, darlin' one     
Your time has come
Hey, darlin' one   

Five hundred midnights since have passed
Since I held you fast         
You were safe at last               
Wax burnt my finger like a clear blue flame
So young and tame    
I was to blameN' I call your name, darlin' one
Your time has come
I said hey, darlin' one
Your time has just begun

I cupped my hands around you
and I swore you would fly  
My tears fell through the dirt
as I heaved you to the sky

and I heard, ";Darlin' one
Your time has come
Your time has come
Hey, darlin', darlin', darlin' one";

Hey, darlin' one, your time has come
