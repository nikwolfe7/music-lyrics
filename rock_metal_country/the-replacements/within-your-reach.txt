I could live without so much
I can die without a clue
Sun keeps risin' in the west
I keep on wakin' fully confused

I never seen no mountain
Never swam no sea
City got me drownin'
I guess it's up to me

I can't? live without your touch 2x

Cold without so much
Can die without a dream
Live without your touch
I'll die within your reach

Reach
ReachI never seen no mountain
Never swam no sea
Drownin' in this city 
Well, it's really up to me

I can't? live without your touch 3x

Die within your reach
Die within your reach
Die within your reach
Die within your reach

Reach
Die within your 
Reach
Die within your 
Reach

Reach ... for the sky
