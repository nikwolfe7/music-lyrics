  to you
Who do you think you are?
You think you are a star
Tryin?to run the town
Always tryin?to put us down
Well, you think that you're right
You think you're out of sight
Tell me something mister
Why'd you have to make us so uptight?
Well you say you've been tryin?You know that you're lyin?I think you need some groovin?Who do you think you're foolin?now?
Well you better start changin?Your life need rearrangin?You better do some talkin?or you better do
  some walkin?now

Yeah, you think that you're right
You think you're out of sight
Tell me something mister
Why'd you have to make us so uptight?

I know what you're doin?All that you been doin?wrong

Well, you think that you're right
Tell me something mister why'd you have to
  make us so uptight?
