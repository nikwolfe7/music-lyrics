Fall in love with a twisted lady
Suicide with a cover girl
Spent all your time then you got stuck paying the price

Uptown, kick it down, into a spin
Face the wall, take it all, you just can't win

Can't stand the heartache
So bleeds the red, red rose
Time heals a broken heart
But that's just the way it goes
Can't stand, can't stand the heartache

You got caught in the line of fire
Bystander innocence
You held your own till it wasn't yours anymore

Waste away another day into the night
You're at home by the phone, it don't seem right

Can't stand the heartache
So bleeds the red, red rose
Time heals a broken heart
But that's just the way it goes
Can't stand, can't stand the heartache

You held me like a prisoner
And I don't know
Why I stayed here from the start

Uptown, run me down under your wheels
I pray, one day, you'll know how it feels

Can't stand the heartache
So bleeds the red, red rose
Time heals a broken heart
But that's just the way it goes
Can't stand, can't stand the heartache

Can't stand the heartache
So bleeds the red, red rose
Time heals a broken heart
But that's just the way it goes
Can't stand, can't stand the heartache

Can't stand the heartache
So bleeds the red, red rose
Time heals a broken heart
But that's just the way it goes
