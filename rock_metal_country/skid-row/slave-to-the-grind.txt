Sebastian Bach/Rachel Bolan/Snake
You got me forced to crack my lids in two
I'm still stuck inside the rubber room
I gotta punch the clock that leads the blind
I'm just another gear in the assembly line - oh no

The noose gets tighter around my throat
But I ain't at the end of my rope 'cause
I won't be the one left behind
Can't be king of the world
If you're slave to the grind
Tear down the rat racial slime
Can't be king of the world
If you're slave to the grind
Get it?

A routine injection, a lethal dose
But my day in the sun ain't even close
There's no need to waste your prayers on me
You better mark my words 'cause
I'm history
Yes indeed

You might beg for mercy to get by
But I'd rather tear this thorn from my side 'causeI won't be the one left behind
You can't be king of the world
If you're slave to the grind

They swallowed their daggers by turning their tricks
They tore my intentions apart brick by brick
I'm sick of the jive
You talk verbal insecticide

Tear down the rat racial slime
You can't be king of the world
If you're slave to the grind

I said slave to the grind
Slave to the grind
Slave to the grind
