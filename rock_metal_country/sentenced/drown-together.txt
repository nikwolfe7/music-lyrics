music: Tenkula & SENTENCED, lyrics: Lopakka
Take this love, my dear, and cherish it in your heart
You shall have no fear'
Nothing could tear us apart
Accept this love sincere, from the bottom of my heart
for now our time is here'
and love shall heal the scars
Now twilight hides the clear, and haunts the day away
We cross the last frontier,
and it sets our hearts ablaze
The Waves lie still and gleaming on Our Sea
'and we're drifting down the stream'
Let's drown ourselves in this love
my darling, my only one
Let's give our lives for this love we are in
- make it forever'
Let me dry your tears
and hold you in embrace
Until we disappear in the crimson haze
The Flames rise still so freezing on Our Sea
'and we're drifting down the stream'
Let's drown ourselves in this love
my darling, my only one
Let's give our lives for this love we are in
we'll do it together'
"'and we take our dive into the waters of eternity'
'here all pain has died and the only ones are you and me'"
The Haze lies still and bleeding on Our Sea
'and we're drifting down the stream'
-to eternity!
 Let's drown ourselves in this love
 my darling, my only one
 Let's set sacrifices for this love we are in
- make it forever'
Let's drown ourselves in this love
Let's give our lives for this love we are in
we'll do it together'
