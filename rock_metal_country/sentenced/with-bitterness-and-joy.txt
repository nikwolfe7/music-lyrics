music: Tenkula & SENTENCED, lyrics: Lopakka
It has now spread itself all over inside me
all the way to the brain and down to my knees
My time comes closer with each day it lets me see
- with each night the pain keeps me from sleep

Life has given me much - maybe taken more
but those good times were always worth waiting for
When it's time for goodbyes I will leave grieving and yet so relieved
with bitterness and joy

Pleasure and pain; Heaven and Hell - my memories
What a long and strange trip this has been for me
What a short and strange life this has been

It has given me much - maybe taken more
but those good times were always worth waiting for
When it's time to take leave of this world
I will leave with bitterness and joy

What a long and strange trip this has been for me
What a short and strange life this has been

It has given me much - maybe taken more
but those good times were always worth waiting for
When it's time for goodbyes I will leave grieving and yet so relieved
with bitterness and joy

Life has given me much - maybe taken more
but those good times were always worth waiting for
When it's time to take leave of this world
I will leave with bitterness and joy
