music: Laihiala & SENTENCED, lyrics: Laihiala
No, you don't want me to be there
To kiss your eyes, caress your hair or kill that pain away
As pain is my companion, solitude my guide
Your sweet affection solely offers me a threat I cannot abide

Yet you'll lose yourself in me in me

Bleed in my arms wounds within
Fall from grace as I offer you sin
Sacrifice yourself so frail
This pseudo-love is as good as betrayal

So place your love in the palm of my hand
where temptation lies within that something you've yet to feel
And as I close my fist and awake your sleeping fears
Without forbearance I will quench my thirst of your crimson tears

You've lost yourself in me in me

Bleed in my arms wounds within
Fall from grace as I offer you sin
Sacrifice yourself so frail
This pseudo-love is as good as betrayal

Weep for promises which all died
A drop of tear for every lie
Love forever torn away
I am only to cherish your pain

I am only to cherish your pain
