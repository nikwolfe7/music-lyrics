music: Laihiala & SENTENCED, lyrics: Laihiala
She was no longer precious to me
I guess my hate grew much stronger than my love for her ever did
I was so tired of chasing that person who made me feel loved
and as we were embracing I cut and spilt the dearest blood

I'm praying for her soul as this blood on my hands stains me whole

You were my life, from you I fed of
And now parted by knife - the suicide of our love
So callous and frigid was that stillborn soul
yet no other half could ever make me whole

You promised: "'til death do us part", and then you made a stone of my
heart

And with the last rays of the setting sun the loveless pulse fades away
No more beating as one, no longer burns the flame

Gone are the times when I felt alive
Gone are those nights with you by my side
And now here I stand as the shadows grow deep
With the death on my hand at your grave I weep

We were one yet not the same
Once passion abundant, now pain

And with the last rays of the setting sun the loveless pulse fades away
No more beating as one, no longer burns the flame

Love laved with stillness like the grave in my heart
and all the reasons huddled in your seeping blood

And with the last rays of the setting sun the loveless pulse fades away
No more beating as one, no longer burns the flame
And with the last rays of the setting sun she bled her love away
No more beating as one, no longer burns the flame
