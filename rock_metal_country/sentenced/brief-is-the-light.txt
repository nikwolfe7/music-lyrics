The bells again...someone has died
The bells of the end toll to remind
that life's but a race against time

At your back you'll always hear
The Chariot of Time hurrying near
The faster you run the closer it comes
A pursuer you can not outrun

Hear these words I say:
- Make the most out of your day
For brief is the light on our way
On this momentary trail

Hear these words, awake:
- Make the most out of your day
For brief is the time, so brief is the time
that we're allowed to stay

The bells again...whose turn this time?
To reach the end, yours or mine?
Each funeral just makes us realize
that life's but a series of goodbyes

Hear these words I say:
- Make the most out of your day
For brief is the light on our way
On this momentary trail

too late

Hear these words I say:
- Make the most out of your day
For brief is the light on our way
On this momentary trail

Hear these words, awake:
- Make the most out of your day
For brief is the time, so brief is the time
that we're allowed to stay

Life passes by, melts away like snow in the spring
We all are blind to the running of time
