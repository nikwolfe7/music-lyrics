You, you say, you have lost the way
Got no alm just livin'for today
Look up to the sky above
And see the morning sun again
You got so much power lnside
So cry It out my friend

I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive.I'm alive

There's no use in hangin' all around
You're a king can't you see your crown

Look into my eyes
So many things are waiting to be done
You just need a friend
Together we will sing along

I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive.I'm alive

Look into my eyes
So many things are waitlng to be done
You just need a friend
Together we will sing along

I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive.1'm alive

I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive.1'm alive
