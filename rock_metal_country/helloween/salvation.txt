Sent to a world cold as steel
Dont know where else I have been
Where will I go - I cant tell
Who would save us if we fell
Can you feel what I see
In blind faith would you believe
Dont share my point of view
But it may mean a lot to you
Tell me will we remember
How it used to be
Will it be the same 
In a time in the future
Will there be a different way
Can one ever say
Anthem for a distant world
We'll all be alike
Be there til eternity
One will see
When salvation comes our way
All my life I was sure
Kept my thoughts clean, real and pure
Just as I will always know
Were down here to learn and grow
I am my own entity
And the world is there for free
Keeps me alive til that day
When my soul will find the way
In another dimension
You may find paradise
We'll be safe and warm
Ive been told there will be everyone
I held so close and near
There will be no fear
Anthem for a distant world
He ll be all alike
Be there til eternity
One will see
When salvation comes our way
