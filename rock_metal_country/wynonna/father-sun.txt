Strange imaginations, children hide your secrets well
Is it not temptation makes you kiss and makes you tell?
There's a traveller on the airwaves and he's pleading for my heart
Light up all the candles, I'm still in the dark

Hurry operator, get redemption on the line
Pull back the curtains, I think I recognize those eyes
If love is so criminal, then my penance due
'Cause I'm still holdin' on to letters written straight to you

Chorus

Oh, won't you save me, father sun, father sun?
I need to tell you father sun, father sun
And now you know that you're the only one
Oh, please forgive me father sun, father sun

I said I needed you in the back of my mind
Laid the beads up on the table, right besides the wine
It seems that we say forever, but forever's just a word
";And I we'll be coming back for you,"; is all I heard

Repeat Chorus

Please don't forget me, father sun, father sun

I think I hear him whispering
";Put your hand in mine and you won't feel a thing!";

Repeat Chorus

Oh, won't you save me father sun, father sun?
I need to tell you that my life is on the run
And now you know that you're the only one
Oh, won't you save me father sun, father sun?
Oh, won't you save me father sun, father sun?

Oh, won't you save me, save me, save me, save me, save me, father sun?
