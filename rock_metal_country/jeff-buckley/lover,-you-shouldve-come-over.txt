Looking out the door 
 I see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations 
  as their shoes fill up with water
And maybe I'm too young
To keep good love from going wrong
But tonight you're on my mind so
 you'll never know

I'm broken down and hungry for your love 
With no way to feed it
Where are you tonight? 
 Child, you know how much I need it.
Too young to hold on 
And too old to just break free and run 
Sometimes a man gets carried away,
When he feels like he should be having his fun
And much too blind to see the damage he's done
Sometimes a man must awake to find that, really,
He has no-one...

So I'll wait for you... And I'll burn oh
Will I ever see your sweet return,
 oh/or, will I ever learn?
Lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late.

Lonely is the room the bed is made
The open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one 
 who dreams he had you with him 
My body turns and yearns for a sleep
 that will never come
It's never over,
 my kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over, all my riches for her smiles 
 when I slept so soft against her...
It's never over,
 all my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over, she is the tear
 that hangs inside my soul forever
Maybe I'm just too young to keep good love
 from going wrong 
Oh... lover you should've come over...
 'cause it's not too late...
I feel too young to hold on              
 I'm much too old to break free and run
 Too deaf, dumb, and blind
  to see the damage I've done
 Sweet lover, you should've come over
 Oh, love I'm waiting [I waited] for you
 Lover, you should've come over
 Cause it's not too late
