Originally performed by The Nymphs
Through the yard, through the yard of blonde girls.
Through the river and the sea.
Gold sharks glittering.
A tree of white breaks the earth.
The streets where Lola played.
Very sexy, very sexy. Okay, okay.
Fear we may come.
Fear we may come.
Fear we may come.
Fear we may come.
So run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
It's in your heart, it's in your art, your beauty.
Even in this world of lies, there's purity,
You've got innocense in your eyes.
Even in this world of lies, you're still hopeful.
Very sexy. Okay, okay.
Fear we may come.
Fear we may come.
Fear we may come.
Fear we may come.
So run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
Through the yard, through the yard of blonde girls.
Through the river and the sea.
Gold sharks glittering.
A tree of white breaks the earth.
The streets where Lola played.
Very sexy, very sexy. Okay, okay.
Fear we may come.
Fear we may come.
Fear we may come.
Fear we may come.
So run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
