I've been there, done that
Ooh-ooh
Yeah been there, yeah done that
I've been there, done that

I gotta take some time
Say what's on my mind
Before I get too close to you
Cos I feel that I'm
About to cross the line
And there's no going back once I do

So here's the key
You've ever thought of falling so deep
Am I pushing you out of your day
How do you feel
Gotta know your playing for keeps
Boy I won't accept anything less

Cos I've been there been there
Done that done that
I don't wanna get hurt again, matter of fact
I refuse to refuse to
Go back go back
To half-hearted promises, simple as that

I've been there, done that

Now I don't wanna rush
Get too into us
I need a little more from you
And I don't mean to fuss
But this is serious
And I hope that you feel that way too

So here's the key
You've ever thought of falling so deep
Boy the time has come to confess

Gotta know your playing for keeps
