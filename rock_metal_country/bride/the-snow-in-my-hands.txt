I've seen them. so dark. Black. And yet fine.
The flower they carry had once been mine.
Get away from me, man of stories. Robe of lies.
Stay far from me. I lie to myself it's not
hurting. I need help, but not from you or
yor father. No! Jesus Christ. Who's my
saviour Lose myself in gods death. No! I can't
bear all this pain. I had watched the snow
all day. Falling. It never lets up. All day
falling. I lifted my voice and wept out loud,
 So this is life .
