You'll hide among the covers and wave as the aeroplanes go by 
There's nothing to say when you sleep all day but "bye bye". 

Your mind will find another and that's where the days have gone 
And all you can hear is a stereo somewhere playing a pig of a song 

And you'll know her know her when she comes. 
When you turn the light out light out she'll come. 

She called you from across the city you hired a car to crawl, 
But with the high rise still in your eyes you wonder who's out there at all. 

And you'll know her, know her, when she comes. 
When you turn the light out, light out, she'll come. 
When you turn the light out, she'll come. 

Stop making me older, start making me new.
