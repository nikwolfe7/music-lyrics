Well the money's pouring down and the people all look down,
And it's floating out of town
I hit the second deck and I spend my paycheck,
And my wife that I just met, she's looking like a wreck

Casino Queen, my lord you're mean
I've been gambling like a fiend on your tables so green

I always bet on black, blackjack,
I'll pay you back
The room fills with smoke and I'm already broke,
And the dealer keeps on joking as he takes my last token

Casino Queen, my lord you're mean
I've been gambling like a fiend on your tables so green

Casino Queen, my lord you're mean
I've been gambling like a fiend on your tables so green
