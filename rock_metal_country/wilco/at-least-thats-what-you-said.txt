When I sat down on the bed next to you 
You started to cry 
I said, maybe if I leave, you'll want me 
To come back home 
Or maybe all you mean, is leave me alone 
At least that's what you said 

You're irresistible when you get mad 
Isn't it sad, I'm immune 
I thought it was cute 
For you to kiss 
My purple black eye 
Even though I caught it from you 
I still think we're serious 
At least that's what you said
