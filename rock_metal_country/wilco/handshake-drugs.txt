I was chewin' gum for something to do 
The blinds were being pulled down on the dew 
Inside, out of love, what a laugh 
I was looking for you 

Saxophones started blowing me down 
I was buried in sound 
Taxicabs were driving me around 
To the handshake drugs I bought downtown 
To the handshake drugs I bought downtown 

They were translated poorly, I felt like a clown 
I looked like someone I used to know 
I felt alright 
And if I ever was myself 
I wasn't that night 

Oh it's okay for you to say 
What you want from me 
I believe that's the only 
Way for me to be, exactly 
What you want me to be 

Oh it's okay for you to say 
What you want from me 
I believe that's the only 
Way for me to be 
Exactly what you want me to be
