There's a random painted highway 
And a muzzle of bees 
My sleeves have come unstitched 
From climbing your tree 

And dogs laugh, some say they're barking 
I don't think they're mean 
Some people get so frightened 
Of the fences in between 

And the sun gets passed from tree to tree 
Silently, and back to me 
With the breeze blown through 
Pushed up against the sea 
Finally back to me 

I'm assuming you got my message 
On your machine 
I'm assuming you love me 
And you know what that means 

Sun gets passed, sea to sea 
Silently, and back to me 
With the breeze blown through 
Pushed up above the leaves 

With the breeze blown through 
My head upon your knee 
Half of it's you, half is me 
Half of it's you, half is me
