Theologians 
They don't know nothing 
About my soul 
About my soul 

I'm an ocean 
An abyss in motion 
Slow motion 
Slow motion 

Inlitterati lumen fidei 
God is with us everyday 
That illiterate light 
Is with us every night 

Theologians 
That don't know nothing 
About my soul 
Oh they don't know 

They thin my heart with little things 
And my life with change 
Oh in so many ways 
I find more missing every day 

Theologians 

I'm going away 
Where you will look for me 
Where I'm going you cannot come 

No one's ever gonna take my life from me 
I lay it down 
A ghost is born 
A ghost is born 
A ghost is born 

I'm an ocean 
I'm all emotion 
I'm a cherry ghost 
Cherry ghost 

Hey I'm a cherry ghost 
A cherry ghost
