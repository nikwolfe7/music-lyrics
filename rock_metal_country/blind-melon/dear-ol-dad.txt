Come now and listen babe
I gotta reason why I behave
Like a child with a light in eyes
Running naked on a cold winter night
I am like a pigeon that is spreading
it's wings to fly away to better things
Like a hammer that has made
a dent in every little single cent you've spent

Said oh God you've got to help me a little bit
you've got to have a relief file for me

Now I know I'm always right, that's a
thought that never even crossed my mind
Don't touch me there, I've gotta be pure
So smack that hand, and read this verse
So I wrecked your life, what the heck
My new found faith will pay by check
This life's took a toll on my soul

So this is me and that's my song
And I guess that you can see that we don't get along
I've shut the doors on what we had
so now she can sleep with her Dear ol' Dad
my eyes are dry and my hands are clean
and I can't believe all the things I've seen

[Chorus]

Oh My God!
