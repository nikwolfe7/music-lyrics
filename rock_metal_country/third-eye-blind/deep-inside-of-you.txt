When we met light was shed 
Thoughts free flow you said you've got something 
Deep inside of you 
A wind chime voice sound, sway of your hips round rings true 
It goes deep inside of you 
These secret garden beams, changed my life so it seems 
Fall breeze blows outside, I don't break stride 
My thoughts are warm 
And they go deep inside of you 
And I never felt alone, 'till I met you 
Friends say I've changed, I don't listen 'cause I live to be 
Deep inside of you 
Slide of her dress, shouts in darkness, I'm so alive 
I'm deep inside of you 
You said boy make girl feel good 
But still, deep inside, still 
I've never felt alone 
'Till I met you 
I'm all right on my own 
And then I met you 
And I'd know what to do if I just knew what's coming 
I would change myself if I could 
I'd walk with my people if I could find them 
And I'd say that I'm sorry to you 
I'm sorry to you 
And I don't want to call you 
But then I want to call you 'cause I don't want to crush you 
But I feel like crushing you 
And it's true I took for granted you were with me 
I breathe by your looks and you look right through me 
And we were broke and didn't know 
And we were broke and didn't know 
And we were broke and didn't know 
Something's gone, you withdraw and I'm not strong like before I was 
Deep inside of you 
I can go nowhere 
I burn candles and stare at a ghost 
Deep inside of you 
And some great need in me starts to bleed 
I've lost myself there's nothing left, it's all gone 
Deep inside of you 
Deep inside of you 
Deep inside of you
