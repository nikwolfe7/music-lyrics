The guy who put his hands on you 
Has got nothing to do with me 
And the bruises that you feel will heal 
And I hope you'll come around 
'Cause we're missing you 
And you used to speak so easy 
Now you're afraid to talk to me 
It's like walking with the wounded 
Carrying that weight way too far 
The concrete pulled you down so hard 
Out there with the wounded 
Missing you 
Well I never claimed to understand what happens after dark 
But my fingers catch sparks at the thought of touching you 
When you're wounded 
Let me break it down 'till I force the issue 
We miss your face and you know I wish you 
Would come back down the the Dalva Bar 
You tell 'em, that's just my battle scar 
I want to kiss you 
And knock 'em down like we used to 
You're the marigold 
Till you're walking down shaking that ass again 
And then you walk on, baby walk on, you walk on, on and on 
You're an angel in the pit with her hands in the air 
And we're missing you 
Now it's fall, and your shoulders get tighter 
Nervous flicks on the lighter, boots 
Your pissed off poets, your women's groups 
And the friends with you, we should have known this fool 
Well I guess we missed the mark 
Still my fingers catch the sparks at the thought of them touching you 
Now you're wounded 
Let me break it down 'till I force the issue 
You never come around, and you know we miss you 
Well nobody took your pride away 
I said, that's something people say 
Back down the bully to the back of the bus 
'Cause it's time for them to be scared of us 
'Till you're yelling, how we living cause you got the ball 
Then you rock on baby, rock on, you rock on, on and on 
You're a summer time hottie with her socks in the air 
You're screaming I don't care baby I don't care 
You say you don't know 
You say you can't grow 
All I know is we're missing you 
You say you don't know 
You say you can't grow 
All I know is we're missing you
