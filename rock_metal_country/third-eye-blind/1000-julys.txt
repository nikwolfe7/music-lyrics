Planning my attack just before you come back around 
Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't know how to back down 
I never fit in, I don't belong 
But you know it doesn't matter when we're feeling strong 
Cause I'm a vampire y'all 
And we toast the blood of our enemies 
You're still scaring me no, you're scaring me no 
And we don't fit in 
Wonder what it's like when you're living with someone like me 
I'm a freak and I'm nervous when it's easy 
Feral days, and I'm sex crazed 
I put it in with my animal ways 
That's the sign I was born to be living in 
I ran around and gave the finger to the Ritalin 
You can calm me down, I can't say why 
You say goodbye, you burn my eyes, you burn my eyes 
A thousand Julys 
I hope you'll find I'd give you the words, but no words come to mind 
But you turn me so cold, so I tell you lies 
When you let me in, it's like a thousand Julys 
When you left for good, I felt the drop like a boom 
Wintertime all alone in your bedroom 
I don't blame you, and I know I'm not your friend 
How we living, young American 
I guess I've always known 
I'd be on my own, I'd be on my own 
And I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why 
A thousand Julys 
I know you'll find I'd say the words, but no words come to mind 
But you let me in 
And I don't know why 
When you come, it's like a thousand Julys 
A thousand Julys 
That's what you are 
I'd tell you to come back now, but we've gone to far 
And we've burned it out now 
I don't even try 
But I feel you gone 
I've lost a thousand Julys
