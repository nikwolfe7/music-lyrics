Still twisting and suggesting
Some passengers
Play with my nerves
It paralyses dexterity
Inculcating anxiety
Can compromise my reason
Reach out of trance
How could I stop the entrance
Over the stress
I have to find the weakness
Involve a quest 
Between my mind and myself
Head is like a burning house
What can I do for my rescue
Inverse the strike to take the lead
Then following what I believe
Ain't got the same conception
I'm now able
To push those spirits outside
My thought is free
And forever lives in me
Psychic transfer
I've stolen their unique power
Nothing can stop the evacuation
