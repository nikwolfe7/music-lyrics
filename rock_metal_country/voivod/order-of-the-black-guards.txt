The men in the black forces
Listen to your conscience
Stopping the evolution
The books are the essence
United to burn anything that can make a stand
The church is an empire, the no way direction
No matter what you say
They run completely blind
No matter what you wrote
Shut up you lie !
And the books are burning hard
Your mind is running slow
Your mind is running slow
Your mind is running slow
Light up a fire in the middle of the city
Burning all the thoughts
Of those who got some ideas
The mission will continue throughout time
Manipulation of all fragile minds
Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn!...
Down! Down! Down! Down!...
Don't want to endure it anymore
Much too radical
The future intelligence falls into enemy hands
Don't want to hear it anymore
Much too political
Spending the time in ignorance
Computers blow up 
By the shock of the present
The blackguards control
The blackguards control
