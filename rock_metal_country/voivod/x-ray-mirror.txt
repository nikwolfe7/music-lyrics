Tunnel seems so long
Touching the bottom
A slim reflexion
Punctured my vision
I didn't notice
Beside the last door
Standing on nothing
There was a mirror

Even inside...scrutinized
I am, he is, the face I hate
Refracting cells and prismed self
Who's x who's y in a blank place
I can't believe this is my image
Like the mirror without a frame

Baring a scarred side
Open in daylight
Recoil and reply
Farside of my pride
The introspection
Ruptures the blood core
Magnification
Draws out the mirror
Seeking me out
What will he find?I am, he is, a repugnant state
I can't shake this curiosity
My privacy starts to fade
I can't believe this is my image
Like the mirror

A polar exchange
He gloating over my fleeting image
He used to be me
He knows who is free
How long will I wait...here
Stuck in this void place...here
I can't believe I am the immage
Within the mirror
Into the chrome lake
The glass is broken
But I look the same
