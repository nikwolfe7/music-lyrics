Direct strategy
Against authority
Setting bombs anywhere
Terrorists everywhere
Phantoms execute
What must be their rules
Like a spy disappears
When the trouble is near
The chaosmngers
Prefer to get away
When people fall down
But they killed the wrong ones 
Certainly out of touch
Opinion grows too much
Diplomatic outfits
To control all the risk
Searching for dissidents
Hyper assassins
Hit with simplicity
Big opportunity
The chaosmngers
Prefer to get away
When people fall down
But they killed the wrong ones 
I've gotta know
Who's living here
I've gotta go
Where I can live
Nothing bad happens
To the ones concerned
So if you're upset
Don't take my life to bet
They're gonna see
I'm not from here
No one is free
There's too much fear
During the Craven's war
Please don't ask for more
See what we passed by
A thousand crimes and lies
The social infection is here
Paranoia complication is near
The bluffer's corporation goes on
Another attempted murder
Breaks down
Cause...have strange echoes
Most...of your right goes
Same...same old story
Shame...ain't no glory
Straight...ahead from you
Blame...is waiting for you
Hate...all over you
