I don't want to go home
I'm feeling like a ghost
I'm falling all apart
Could you please fix my heart?

Why don't we leave this old town?
A new world waits to be seen
Give me a reason to stay
I'm not afraid to live

Tell me now...
What do you read in my hand?
Please don't spell me wrong
What is going on?

Tell me now...
What is seen from my hand?
I know what is true
Nothing's really new

Why don't we leave this old town?
A new world waits to be seen
Give me a reason to stay
I'm not afraid to live...Tell me now...
All my will and destiny
Won't erase my hand
It won't change my plans

Tell me now...
What could be the best for me?
It's always been the same
I'm running like a train

I don't want to go home
I'm feeling like a ghost
I'm falling all apart
Could you please fix my heart?

Why don't we leave this old town?
A new world waits to be seen
Give me a reason to stay
I'm not afraid to live

Here we go...
No one said it was easy
I'm on my feet again
A ticket in my hand
Here we go...
