Loud echoes from the end
Nothing but a flat lie
All I need is a new world
Create my universe
The four basic forces 
Are ready and fixed 
All set to prove myself
It really exists
Risk it, try it, find it !
If my body cannot stand
Don't wanna be born again
I have enough of my land
Putting myself in this project
Within a space that's still secret
Am I to blame for future fate ?
A ball of energy
Vortex around me
I have to realize
My theory is wise
The four basic forces 
Are ready and fixed 
All set to prove myself
It really exists
Risk it, try it, find it !
I think I've found the way
I wanna move not stay
Time is fast and so unsafe
Conquest is what I can expect
Without frontiers there's no respect
The less you give the more I take
Burst getting stronger
In atoms smasher
Powerful magnets
Interchanges the mass
Annihilation, a full reaction
The protons travel 
In a big circle
Meeting in this race
Their mirror-image
Dematerialized
Body lost its size
Tube without exit
No way out of it
Micro-galaxies
A lot more to see
Magnetic fusion
My self-creation
I'm in the machine
Going through my dreams
