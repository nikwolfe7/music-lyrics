Crucible heats up
Arsening, mercury
And acid concoct
Hermetic theory
Hydrogen vapours
Exclusion principle
It's never over
For ever practical

And I try
Throughout time
Any rite
For the signLight rebounds
Pure neon
I surround
All am I, I am all
Fluorescent light
Pellucid mineral
Essential dogma
Excludes the logical
Immobile centre
One, two, three for nothing
Projection ponder
Under a raven's wing
Catalyst fusion
Inner combustion
A transmutation
For I am all
