Stalled at young modern station
Arthritic conversation
Life has a dead line lately
Allergic and in the news

The clocks are ticking timeless
Dead Dali days behind us
The band is back together
Allergic and in the news

Does it make you cry
When I make you feel so far away
The interviews over
Stuck to the goal
To rescue my skin

I need a different liquor
So sick of getting sicker
And I'm moving back to the country
Allergic and in the news

Does it make you cry
When I make you feel so far away
The interviews over
Stuck to the goal
To rescue my skin
You're so far away
The interviews over

He dreams of tracks and choices
I think I'm hearing voices

Does it make you cry
When I make you feel so far away
The interviews over
Stuck to the goal
To rescue my skin
You're so far away
The interviews over
