I took advantage
Of a straight believing town
That tore the bandage
And said look who's bleeding now
Are you listening or are you faithless like the others
Long days are almost here
Faded signs for you

I'll be waiting all day
I've be waiting all year
For you it's true
He's been beaten
Might have brought it on himself
So he stopped reading
Every book on mental health
But alls not lost in this tangle like no other

Long days are almost here
Faded signs for you
I'll be waiting all day
I've be waiting all year
For you it's true

Take this dose and go
Whiskey warm September
The faded sign will show
That he still remembers

Long days are almost here
Faded signs for you
I'll be waiting all day
I've be waiting all year
For you it's true

Waiting all day
Waiting all year

I'll be waiting all day
I'll be waiting all year
