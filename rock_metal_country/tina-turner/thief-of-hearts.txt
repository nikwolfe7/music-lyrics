Let me tell you about a man I knew...
yeah, I knew him all too well
huh, my attitude has always been
you can have me for tonight, not for tomorrow
it's gonna cost you plenty yeah, 
more than you can afford or you can borrow
Well I can make'm fall in love
just as easy as I pick their pockets hey
and when I've done the deed
I jump on a freight train and make my getaway

I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night
before they knew what hit them I was out of sight
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes
cause now you've gone and stolen mine

Yeah, I met you on a starry night, full moon in your eyes
did something strange to me
I was all prepared to spin my web, take you for a ride
there was a fork in the street
Well I didn't mean to fall in love,
didn't practice the rules that I've been taught
You never get involved, never drop your defences
but this time I got caught

I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night
before they knew what hit them I was out of sight
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes
cause now you've gone and stolen mine
Thief of hearts, paying for my crimes
Thief of hearts, and now you've gone and stolen mine

Feel so good I want more, it should be against the law yeah
I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night
before they knew what hit them I was out of sight
Aahhhhh, thief of hearts, a burglar in the night
before they knew what hit them I was out of sight
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes
cause now you've gone and stolen mine
Thief of hearts, I've been a thief of hearts
Thief of hearts
Been a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night
before they knew what hit them I was out of sight
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes
cause now you've gone and stolen mine
Thief of hearts...
