I heard some news this morning
And it almost devastated me
It hit my heart without a warning
The story is on the street
I overheard a conversation it was all about you
I can't believe what they're saying baby, it better not be true

They say you know who is doing you know what
How am I supposed to feel
You know who is doing you know what
I thought our love was real

They say you can't believe everything you hear
But you've got me feeling insecure
I thought you and I had a good thing going
Now baby I'm not so sure
I'm gonna have mixed emotions when I see you tonight
I'm afraid I see the true story when I look in your eyes

They say you know who is doing you know what
Baby I've got to know
You know who is doing you know what
I don't wanna let you go

I don't wanna be jumping to conclusions 
I would rather keep my trust in you
Is your love for me just an illusion
Baby tell me is it true

You know who is doing you know what
I've got to keep my courage up
You know who is doing you know what
Are you gonna turn your back on love
