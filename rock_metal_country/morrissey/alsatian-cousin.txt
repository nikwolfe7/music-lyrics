Were you and he Lovers ?
And would you say so if you were ?
On a forecourt
On a Friday
Passing my way
Oh...
Were you and he Lovers ?
And if you were, then say that you were!
On a groundsheet
Under canvas
With your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk
";P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!";
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
-Oh!-
Is THAT the best you can do ?
So came his reply :
";But on the desk is where I want you!";
So I ask even though I know:
Were you and he Lovers ?
