It's All In Your Head 
Tony Martin/Van Stephenson/Reese Wilson 

Momma died young giving birth to a son 
In a home for wayward girls 
Daddy was sidewalk, soapbox preacher 
Looking forward to the end of the world 
Every Friday night he'd pick a Jesus fight 
Down at the local pool hall 
Racking up souls condemning all those 
Caught behind the eight ball 
He said I preach for the light - the light shows the way 
Don't ever trust what the government say 
We never walked on the moon 
Elvis ain't dead 
You ain't going crazy 
It's all in your head 

Lucy was a messed up, dressed up waitress 
With a slightly tarnished heart of gold 
She wasn't half bad for a new step momma 
As far as step momma's go 
Daddy knew she was the one as he baked in the sun 
In a parking lot preaching the truth 
Up shot her hand and she cried, oh, man 
I feel it, yes, I feel it I do 
It's been revealed to me down deep in my soul 
There were two shooters on the grassy knoll 
We never walked on the moon 
Elvis ain't dead 
You ain't going crazy 
It's all in your head 
Let us sing 

It's all interpretation 
To find the truth you gotta read between the lines 
Work out your own salvation 
That narrow path is hard to define 
Heaven's more than a place 
It's a state of mind 

In his quest for truth 
Daddy was moved by the spirit 
To take up a snake 
In a moment of doubt the venom turned out 
Stronger than daddy's faith 
But I'll never forget his dying breath 
The last words that he said 
We never walked on the moon 
Elvis ain't dead 
You ain't going crazy 
It's all in your head 
Let me tell ya 

It's all interpretation 
To find the truth you gotta read between the lines 
Work out your own salvation 
That narrow path is had to define 
Heaven's more than a place 
It's a state of mind 
State of mind
