Stuff

Catalogs fillin' up the mailbox 
Home shopping on the cable box 
And www dot 
Oh there's no escape 
Delivery truck coming up 'round the bend 
Beep, beep, beep, just backing in 
Sign here and here and here again 
'Cause it's no money down no payments till 
Your whole place is cram packed filed with 

Chorus 

Stuff stuff stack it on stack it on up 
Stuff never gonna ever get enough stuff 
Oh it's treasure till it's mine then it ain't worth a dime 
It's stuff stuff spreading like weeds 
Dragging me under in an endless sea of stuff 
Stuff There ain't no end 
Got to get a bigger place so I can move in 
More stuff 

It's getting late but it's alright 
The get-it-all mart opened up all night 
You can catch it all with a quick swipe 
It's easier everyday 
Suv's and mini vans 
Parading 'round in caravans 
Toting off more than their tires can stand 
'Cause it's no money down no payments till 
Every square inch of the whole world's filled with 

Chorus 

Bridge 
Drag it in, pack it in 
The man with the most 
He just wins more stuff 

Chorus
