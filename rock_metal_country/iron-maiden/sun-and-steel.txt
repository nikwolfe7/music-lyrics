You killed your first man at 13 
Killer instinct, animal supreme 
By 16 you had learned to fight 
The way of the warrior you took it as your right 

Sunlight, falling on your steel 
Death in life is your ideal 
Life is like a wheel, rolling on and on 

Through the earth and water, fire and wind 
You came at last - nothing was the end 
Make a cut by fire and stones 
Take you and your blade and break you both in two 
Break you both on two 

Sunlight, falling on your steel 
Death in life is your ideal 
Life is like a wheel, and it's rolling still
