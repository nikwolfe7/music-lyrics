Snow is falling down on this glorious land
Colours fading, turning into white again
To fallen heroes angels sing, they cry their winter tears
Endless mourning days will turn to years
So this is goodbye, I take leave of you and
Spread your wings and you will fly away now, fly away
Now
Nothing on earth stays forever
But none of your deeds were in vain
Deep in our hearts you will live again
You're gone to the home of the brave
Every solemn moment I will treasure inside
Even though it's hard to understand
T hat a silent wind can blow the candle out
Taking everything leaving the pain far behind
You call out my name, but your voice is fading
Into the wind, embraced, you'll fly away now, fly away
Now
Nothing on earth stays forever
But none of your deeds were in vain
Deep in our hearts you will live again
You're gone to the home of the brave
My eyes are closed I feel you're faraway  so close 
Far beyond that shining star
I know you'll find what you've been fighting for
Far beyond that shining star
Down on bended knee I pray, bring courage to these Souls
Make'em live forever in the heart of the bold
So I say farewell my friends, I hope we'll meet again
When time has come to fall from grace
So this is goodbye, I take leave of you and
Spread your wings and you will fly away now, fly away
Now
Nothing on earth stays forever
But none of your deeds were in vain
Deep in our hearts you will live again
You're gone to the home of the brave
