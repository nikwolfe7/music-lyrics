We are the voices in the dark 
Inside the fire we are the 
Eternal Spark that will guide the way 

We are the stars up in sky 
We gather winds so you can fly 
We are the light when you're sleeping 

All your dreams can come true 
Where do we go??
We're just a heartbeat away 

Follow the signs of the Crimson Thunder 
We will stay by your side 
Let our voices be there to guide you 

We are the forces in the rain 
Inside your heart we are the 
unending answer to all your fears 

So take a step towards the light 
The crimson sky fullfills the night 
The revelation is near 

All your dreams can come true 
Where do we go??
Were just a heartbeat away 

Follow the signs of the Crimson Thunder
We will stay by your side 
Let our voices be there to guide you 

All your dreams can come true 
Where do we go??
Were just a heartbeat away

Follow the signs of the Crimson Thunderx3
We will stay by your side 
Let our voices be there to guide you times thee
