Sight a brand new horizon 
Ascending from the hearts of those who couldn't see 
The decline of man, the final stage of war 

Spectral forces of mankind 
We're all trapped inside the core of the machine 
Our time has come to find a way back home 

We seek our destiny in thee 
In the eye of the storm 
A genesis is born, reborn 

Riders of the storm - one with the wind, defenders of creation

Riders of the storm - aligned with the sun 

Phantom powers rule the earth 
Descending down, controling you and me 
What is left to see, is it all but a dream 

On the inside looking out 
Kept within a cage, behind a false facade 
They can't keep us down cause our strenght is our will

We dream of a genesis reborn 
Where our spirits fly free 
Let us choose our own destiny 

Riders of the storm - one with the wind, defenders of creation

Riders of the storm - aligned with the sun 

Speak the word of Nemesis 
Call for thunder call for rain 
Let us meet our Genesis 
Save us from the unholy pain 

Riders of the storm - one with the wind, defenders of creation

Riders of the storm - aligned with the sun
