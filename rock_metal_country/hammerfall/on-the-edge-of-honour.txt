Led by temptation into the underworld 
to absence of season and time 
Soldiers of Fortune, Soldiers of the Night 
back to back, ready to fight 

Enchanted gardens, where Evil slipped away 
through darkness, fire and rage 
Uncanny demons will dance upon your grave 
as soon as you become their slave 

Surrender or fight, there's nowhere to turn 
The Bringer of Light, where are you now 
Forever our hearts will burn 

Immortal Riders, Protectors of the Earth 
lost in the abode of the dead 
Misled through darkness and mislead by desire 
inside the midst of the fire 

Surrender or fight, there's nowhere to turn 
The Bringer of Light, where are you now 
Forever our hearts will burn 

Fallen Angels, arise from your graves 
Free your spirits and unite 
before the blood of the Unicorn colors the night 
From the ruins of hell we shall rise 
On The Edge Of Honour we see the light 
of the Unicorn soaring the night 

Born to conquer the fight, 
here we stand with the Future in our hands 
Through fire we'll rise to touch the sky 

Oooh...
