You're just blood in my hands
You mean nothin' man
You're just blood in my hands
You mean nothin' man, man, man
You're just the blood, blood

I can see the moon and I can see the stars
I even see the world except for where you are
Set fire my page, you close the book
Set fire my page, with your sideways look

Cause I hate you, but I need you
I need you to let me go

This duet, let's do it
You're just the blood in my hands
This duet, let's do it
You mean nothin', man
It's duet, it's duet
You're just the blood in my hands
It's duet, it's duet
You're just the blood, blood

Like a bull in a china shop hey
You leave me waitin', waitin' for the chaos to stop
What's wrong with you, there aint no clue
Can't walk in my shoes when they're stompin on you

Cause I hate you, but I need you
I need you to let me go

This duet, let's do it
You're just the blood in my hands
This duet, let's do it
You mean nothin', man
It's duet, it's duet
You're just the blood in my hands
It's duet, it's duet
You're just the blood, blood

Cause I hate you, but I need you
I need you to let me go
Cause I hate you, but I need you
I need you to let me go

Every time you speak to me
Your words drenched in hypocracy
And every time you look down on me
I feel no worth in what you see
And I feel no worth in what you need
And I feel no worth in what you see

This duet, let's do it
You're just the blood in my hands
This duet, let's do it
You mean nothin', man
It's duet, it's duet
You're just the blood in my hands
It's duet, it's duet
You're just the blood, blood

Cause I hate you, but I need you
I need you to let me go
Cause I hate you, but I need you
I need you to let me go go

It's duet, it's duet, it's duet, it's duet, it's duet, it's duet
You're just the blood in my hands
It's duet, it's duet, it's duet, it's duet, it's duet, it's duet
You're mean nothin' man

Ahh, I need another drink
