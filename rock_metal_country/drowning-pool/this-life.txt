And when it's cold out 
I will wait for her 
And I will roam out 
To the edges of the earth 
And when it feels just like the rain 
Has soaked through my bones 
None of this will matter 
None of this will save you from yourself 

This life 
It's brining on the death of me 
Swear that I can barely see 
That I'm the one to blame 
This life 
I swear to God it's killin' me 
Seems some times I can't believe 
That I'm the one to blame 
And when it's cold out 
In the sleet and snow 
I will hold out 
'Till the answers all unfold 
And when it feels just like the rain 
You will see through it all 
None of this will matter 
'Cause none of this will save you from yourself 

None of this will matter 
None of this will save your from yourself
