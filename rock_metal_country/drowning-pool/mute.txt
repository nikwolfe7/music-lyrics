Shouldn't have that far to go
The less you think the more you know
It seems the dream is impossible
Never made a difference so why should you
Promise me you won't look at me
There's nothing left here to talk about
There's nothing left
No matter how hard I try
The lonely one refuses to die
Someday I will be a better man
Never made a difference so why should I
Promise me you won't look at me
