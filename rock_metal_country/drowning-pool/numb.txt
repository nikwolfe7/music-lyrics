Numb 

To the man looking back at me 
Said why don't you go away 
We've all heard your misery 
You've been bleeding it for days end 

And it's plain when I look into your eyes I see 
All you want is everybody's sympathy 

So why don't you take all of this and go away 
So why do you always look to me this way 
When it seems like tomorrow might not come 
And it seems like the sorrow has left you numb 

And to the world I see 
Said we've sat and watched you shine 
Pack up all your guilt and please 
Leave it all behind 

And it's plain when I look into your eyes I see 
This could be the way you want your life to be 

Numb 

Now your gonna bleed 
So why don't you just tell me
