Like cigarettes and gasoline 
I light a match and watch this scene 
Burn away in front of me 
Ashes of my misery 

I swear sometimes I think this life is killing me 

I swear it's killin me 
All our shattered hopes 
And our long dead dreams 
The wreckage that we all try to keep 
From coming to life 
And tearing us apart at the seams 

Sun bleached bones and withered trees 
Slowly rotting just like me 
Empty bottles broken glass 
My resolve is fading fast 

I swear sometimes I think this life is killing me 

I swear it's killin me 
All our shattered hopes 
And our long dead dreams 
The wreckage that we all try to keep 
From coming to life 
And tearing us apart at the seams
