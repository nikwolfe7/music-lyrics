And this blood on my hands 
Now it won't go away 
I've been out on this road for days 

And the fear on the wall 
Watch it slowly cascade 
As the door holds the wolves at bay 

The emptiness is building from 
The nothingness that we've all become 

The emptiness is building from 
The nothingness that we've all become 

And this road that I've chose 
Seems it's taken its' toll 
Leading far far away from the soul 

And the fear on the wall 
Watch it slowly cascade 
As the door holds the wolves at bay 

The emptiness is building from 
The nothingness that we've all become 

The emptiness is building from 
The nothingness that we've all become 

This thing I've become seems its' taken control 
Of my mind and my body my will and my soul 
Driving further and further away from my self 
Until there's none of me left I've become something else 

The emptiness is building from 
The nothingness that we've all become 

The emptiness is building from 
The nothingness that we've all become
