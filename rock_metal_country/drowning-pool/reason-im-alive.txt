Whatever happened to till death do us part?
Together forever slowly severed us apart
You know, dreams are just like lies dreams are just like lies, when you walk away?
I never want to feel again, as the blackness settles in
And I only have one thing left to say

You're the reason that i'm alive
Twist that knife but I just won't die
You're the reason that i'm alive reason that I'm alive
Leave you here as you watch me fly away
Woah-oh, woah-oh, as you watch me fly away
Watch me fly away

Whatever happened to the lies that I believed?
And wasn't it you that said the truth will set us free?
You know, dreams are just like lies dreams are just like lies, when you walk away?
And we never even had a chance, as the sadness slips away
And I only have one thing left to say

You're the reason that i'm alive reason that I'm alive
Twist that knife but I just won't die
You're the reason that i'm alive reason that I'm alive
Leave you here as you watch me fly away
Woah-oh, woah-oh, as you watch me fly away
Woah-oh, woah-oh, as you watch me fly away

I'm rising up on broken wings
And I'm choking back these empty sins
Well I hope you take this, take this as you want

You're the reason that i'm alive reason that I'm alive
Twist that knife but I just won't die
You're the reason that i'm alive reason that I'm alive
Leave you here as you watch me fly away
Woah-oh, woah-oh, as you watch me fly away
Woah-oh, woah-oh, as you watch me fly away
Watch me fly, watch me fly, watch me fly away
Watch me fly, watch me fly, watch me fly away
Watch me fly, watch me fly, watch me fly away
