The phone calls 
Always left me unsure 
They'd never say things of their own accord 
I am preoccupied 
I can't get them out of my mind 
They are terrified 
And if you said jump in the river I would 
Because it would probably be a good idea 
You're not supposed to be here at all now 
It's all been a gorgeous mistake 
Sick one or clean one 
The best one 
That God ever made 
When I kissed you 
You didn't mind 
I thought I tasted of too many cigarettes 
But you tasted like wine 
And I'm not going to change my mind 
Just because of what they said 
The worm has laid eggs in their hearts 
But not in my head 
And if you said jump in the river I would 
Because it would probably be a good idea 
You're not supposed to be here at all now 
It's all been a gorgeous mistake 
Sick one or clean one 
The best one 
That God ever made 
There's been days like this before you know 
And I liked it all 
Like the times we did it so hard 
There was blood on the wall 
And if you said jump in the river I would 
Because it would probably be a good idea 
And if you said jump in the river I would 
Because it would probably be a good idea
