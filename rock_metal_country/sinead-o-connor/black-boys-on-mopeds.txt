Margareth Thatcher on TV 
Shocked by the deaths that took place in Beijing 
It seems strange that she should be offended 
The same orders are given by her 
I've said this before now 
You said I was childish and you'll say it now 
 Remember what I told you 
If they hated me they will hate you  
England's not the mythical land of Madame George and roses 
It's the home of police who kill black boys on mopeds 
And I love my boy and that's why I'm leaving 
I don't want him to be aware that there's 
Any such thing as grieving 
Young mother down at Smithfield 
5 am, looking for food for her kids 
In her arms she holds three cold babies 
And the first word that they learned was  please  
These are dangerous days 
To say what you feel is to dig your own grave 
 Remember what I told you 
If you were of the world they would love you  
England's not the mythical land of Madame George and roses 
It's the home of police who kill blacks boys on mopeds 
And I love my boy and that's why I'm leaving 
I don't want him to be aware that there's 
Any such thing as grieving.
