She took my father from my life oh 
Took my sister and brothers oh 
I watched her torturing my child 
Feeble I was then but now I'm grown 
Fire on Babylon 
Oh yes a change has come 
Fire on Babylon 
Fire 
Fire 
Fire 
She's taken everything I liked 
She's taken every lover oh 
And all along she gave me lies 
Just to make me think I loved her 
Fire on Babylon 
Oh yes a change has come 
Look what she did to her son 
Fire 
Fire 
Fire on 
Life's backwards 
Life's backwards 
People turn around 
The house is burned 
The house is burned 
The children are gone 
Fire 
Fire 
Fire on Babylon 
Oh yes a change has come 
Fire on Babylon 
Fire 
Fire, oh 
Fire, oh 
Fire on Babylon 
Oh yes a change has come 
Look what she did to her son 
Look what she did to her son 
Fire, haha 
Fire, haha 
Fire 
Fire 
Fire, aha 
Fire on Babylon 
Fire on Babylon
