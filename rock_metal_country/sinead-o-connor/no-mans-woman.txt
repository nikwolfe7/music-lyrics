I don't wanna be no man's woman 
It don't make me happy this mantrolling 
Thing that you got for me so I become 
No man's woman 
I don't wanna be no man's woman 
I've other work I want to get done 
I haven't traveled this far to become 
No man's woman 
No Man's woman 
Cuz I'm tired of it 
And I'm not scared of it 
That I'll never trust again 
Cuz a man could fake you 
Take your soul and make you 
Miserable in so much pain 
My friends think I'm alone but I've got secrets 
I don't tell everything about the love I get 
I got a lovin man but he's a spirit 
He never does me harm never treats me bad 
He never takes away all the love he has 
And I forgive him a million times 
I'm never tired of it 
And I'm not scared of it 
Cuz it doesn't cause me pain 
Like a man could fake you 
Take your soul and make you 
Never be yourself again 
I never wanna be no man's woman 
I only wanna be my own woman 
I haven't traveled this far to become 
No man's woman 
No man's woman 
No man's woman
