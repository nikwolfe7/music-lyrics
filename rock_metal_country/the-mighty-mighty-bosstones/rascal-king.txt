From the album Let's Face It
Well he was fueled by a lack
Drew inspiration from a need
So many problems to crack
And mouths to feed
Crooked was the path
And brazen was the walk
A cocky swagger, up the ladder
And could he ever talk
The last hurrah?
Nah! I'd do it again
The Rascal King behind the bars
Or the one in front of them
The love of God
And constant contradictions
With just a smile, wink or nod
What's stranger fact or fiction?
And never ceasing to amaze
On a regular basis
First hand into his pocket 
 Or first fist into the faces
The last hurrah?
Nah! I'd do it again
The Rascal King behind the bars
Or the one in front of them
A legendary character
When?
Only then
Where?
Only there
A hero or a hooligan?
Well, that part's never clear
Pride or shame, it's all the same
Who's innocent or who's to blame?
Politics or just a game?
Well in the end they knew his name
The last hurrah? Nah! I'd do it again
The Rascal King behind the bars
Or the one in front of them
