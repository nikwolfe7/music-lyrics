Sweet memories
Flashing very quickly by
Reminding me
And giving me a reason why
I know that
My goal is more than a thought
I'll be there 
When I teach what I've been taught
And I've been taught...

You know we've told you before
But you didn't hear us then
So you still question why
No! You didn't listen again!
You didn't listen again!

Sweet memories
I never thought it would be like this
Reminding me
Just how close I came to missing
I know that
This is the way for me to go
You'll be there
When you know what I know
And I know...

You know we've told you before
But you didn't hear us then
So you still question why
No! You didn't listen again!
You didn't listen again!
