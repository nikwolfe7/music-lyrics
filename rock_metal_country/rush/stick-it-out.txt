Trust to your instincts
If it's safely restrained
Lightning reactions
Must be carefully trained

Heat of the moment
Curse of the young
Spit out your anger
Don't swallow your tongue

STICK IT OUT
Don't swallow the poison
SPIT IT OUT
Don't swallow your pride
STICK IT OUT
Don't swallow your anger
SPIT IT OUT
Don't swallow the lies

Natural reflex
Pendulum swing
You might be too dizzy
To do the right thing

Trial under fire
Ultimate proof
Moment of crisis
Don't swallow the truth

STICK IT OUT
Don't swallow the poison
SPIT IT OUT
Don't swallow your pride
STICK IT OUT
Don't swallow your anger
SPIT IT OUT
Don't swallow the lies

Each time we bathe our reactions
In artificial light
Each time we alter the focus
To make the wrong moves seem right

You get so used to deception
You make yourself a nervous wreck
You get so used to surrender
Running back to cover your neck

STICK IT OUT
Don't swallow the poison
SPIT IT OUT
Don't swallow your pride
STICK IT OUT
Don't swallow your anger
SPIT IT OUT
Don't swallow the lies
