Handcuffed in the present tense
Variations on your violence
Mind games and pretty girls
A cracked song in the universe
I think it's time that I showed you what I'm made of
I'm afraid there is so much to be afraid of
I kill the fire so I don't get burned
Kill the fire and you won't get burned

Deadwood, if you care to listen
It's the same but there's something missing
It wears me out
Stripped bare I'm the same old savage
How in His name did we ever manage
It's not enough

Look me in the eye
I'm about to dive
Can you live your life without me

I don't need you anymore
I can't use you anymore
Killing the fire and you kill my desire
I don't need you anymore

Loud and clear but you still don't get it
I call you up and then I'll regret it
It gets me down
You want the truth but you look right through it
Deadwood but you hold on to it
It's such a shame

Look me in the eye
I'm about to dive
Can you live your life without me

I don't need you anymore
I can't use you anymore
Killing the fire and you kill my desire
I don't need you anymore

First comes love
Then comes marriage
Then comes baby in a golden carriage
First comes love
Then comes marriage
Then comes baby in a golden carriage

I don't need you anymore
I can't use you anymore
Killing the fire and you kill my desire
Killing the fire and you kill my desire
Killing the fire and you kill my desire
Killing the fire and you kill my desire... 

Symptomatic of what we've become
I used to think you were the only one

First comes love
Then comes marriage
Then comes loneliness.
