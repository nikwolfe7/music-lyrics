My lover's charms 
Are in a box 
Beneath my bed 
And piece by piece 
I'll cherish them 
Until the end 

Send me an angel to love 
I need to feel a little piece of heaven 
Send me an angel to love 
I'm afraid I'll never get to heaven 

They burn my hand 
Scar my face 
And blind my eyes 
I'll steal your breath 
And throw away 
What I despise 

Send me an angel to love 
I need to feel a little piece of heaven 
Send me an angel to love 
I'm afraid I'll never get to heaven 

Between these walls 
And darkened halls 
I've done my time 
If I should die 
Before I wake 
Then you'll know why 

Send me an angel to love 
I need to feel a little piece of heaven 
Send me an angel to love 
I'm afraid I'll never get to heaven Piece by piece 

Send me an angel to love Piece by piece 
I need to feel a little piece of heaven Piece by piece 
Send me an angel to love Piece by piece 
I'm afraid I'll never get to heaven Piece by piece 

Piece by piece 
Piece by piece 
Piece by piece Send me an angel 
Piece by piece Send me an angel 
Piece by piece Send me an angel 
Piece by piece Send me an angel.
