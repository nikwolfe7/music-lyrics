Smokestack lightning
Shine a light home
Smokestack lightning
Shining like gold
Treats me like a clown
Wheels go driving slow
Trucks me out of town
Wheels go driving slow
Tell me baby
So when you coming home
Tell me baby
When you coming home
Wheels go driving slow
Wheels go driving slow
Wheels go driving slow
