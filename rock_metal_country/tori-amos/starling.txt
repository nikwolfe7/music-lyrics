Starling you were right I am the jealous kind
Whoever would have guessed
Starling now I am shut out and confined
Even within my nest

What, what does it take to make it through another day
If a feather lined with his words becomes a blade

Starling when he screams he screams in black and white
Just like the magpie
Shattered night then I woke
Not to a lonely lark but to a raven's cry

If a feather lined with his words becomes a blade
Then what, what will it take to make it through another day

So when they play, play the song
Sing along
It may be your turn to shine
If you know the lines
Hey what's that you say
"You can find, find him online
Most of the time these days"
"Is that right," I say.

You were right Starling
