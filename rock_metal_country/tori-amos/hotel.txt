Met 'em in a Hotel
Met 'em in a Hotel
Beneath ground
Tell me that he's missing
Tell me this is one for
Lollipop Gestapo
You were wild
Where are you now
You were wild
Where are you now
I have to learn to let you crash down
I have to learn to let you crash down
I have to learn to let you crash
Met 'em in a Hotel
Met 'em in a Hotel
You say he's the biggest thing
There'll be this year
I guess that what I"m seeking
I guess that what I'm seeking Isn't here
Met him in a Hotel
Met him in a guess world
Guessesd anyone but you
You were wild
Where are you now
You were wild
Where are you now
Give me more

Give me more
I have to learn to let you crash down
I have to learn to let you crash down
I have to learn to let you crash
Where are the velvets
Where are the velvets
Where are the velvets
When you're coming down
You were wild
Where are you now
You were wild
Where are you now
King Solomon's Mines
Exit 75
I'm still alive
I'm still alive
I'm still alive
