Hey can you hear me
I'm calling your name
hecko  Or is this goodbye
The gleam in your eyes
It troubles my brain
Will I see it again
So I can rest my head

Angel...Angel!  Dancing away
As all of my thoughts get rearranged
Angel...Angel!  Turning away
Just when thing seem
To have changed
So I can rest my head

Hey can you hear me
I'm calling your name
hecko  Or is this goodbye
The gleam in your eyes
It troubles my brain
Will I see it again
So I can rest my head
