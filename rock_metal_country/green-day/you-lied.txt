You gotta problem you just can't hide 
Compulsive habits that never seem to die 
Your breath is taken up all the air 
Your teeth are rotting to black holes in your head 
Well reality is due What you say just can't be true 
When the story is streched and so far fetched 
That you're lacking an excuse 
You Lied 
Your mother allowed you for just one white lie 
But now she's dead,and she left you with a problem 
Pinocchio has pierced your tongue 
Your nose is growin' into the 3rd dimension 
Well reality is due What you say just can't be true 
When the story is stretched and so far fetched 
That you're lacking an excuse 
You Lied 
Well reality is due What you say just can't be true 
When the story is stretched and so far fetched 
That you're lacking an excuse 
You Lied
