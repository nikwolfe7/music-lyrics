Shoplifter, you'll never learn 
When you commit the crime 
Shoplifter, you're getting burned 
And now you gotta do the time 

It's a 1, 2, 3 on the felony 
Well not everything is free 
Now that you served the community
It's the life of a petty thief

It's not considered stealing
Unless you're getting caught 
But you'll be caught stealing
Tryin' to take something you haven't got 

Shoplifter, you'll never learn 
What lies behind your back 
Not a burgler or a bankrobber 
Just a kleptomaniac

It's not considered stealing
Unless you're getting caught 
But you'll be caught stealing
Tryin' to take something you haven't got 

Shoplifter, you'll never learn 
When you commit the crime 
Shoplifter, you're getting burned 
And now you gotta do the time 
Oh now you gotta do the time
Well now you gotta do some time
