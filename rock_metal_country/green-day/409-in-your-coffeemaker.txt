I sit in the state of a daydream
With all of your words flying over my head
Even more time gets wasted
In a daze

It should seem obvious to you
Your screams and cries are never going to work
And all of your time gets wasted
In my daze

And I'm looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing
To break from these chains
These chains that control
My future's aim...

I sit in the state of a daydream
With all of your words flying over my head
Even more time gets wasted
In a daze

Maybe I'm just too darn lazy
Or maybe I was just brainwashed to think that way
And all of your time gets wasted
In my daze

And I'm looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing
To break from these chains
These chains that control
My future's aim...

I'm looking-
back now at-
Where I have-
have gone wrong...
And why I -
could not seem-
Could not seem-
to get along...

And I'm looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing
To break from these chains
These chains that control
My future's aim...
