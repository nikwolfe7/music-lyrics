Dear Amy, see you in September 
Hope that you remember me next year 
Hey Jamie, you've been a great friend to me 
I hope that I'll still see you around here 
'Cause I'm looking through the yearbook then I find that empty space 
There's a name without a picture, but I can't forget his face 
Tell me where did he go, I want to know 
Where did Johnny go? 
It says, "Picture unavailable" right here 
More than sad, it makes me mad to know somebody knows 
There's a lying in your silence. Tell me where did Johnny go? 
Poor Katie, she won't even speak his name 
None of us will ever be the same 
It's quiet in the halls, but I hear echoing off the walls. 
The rumors of Johnny's mystery 
'Cause I'm looking through the yearbook then I find that empty space 
No he never wrote me nothing, but I can't forget his face 
Repeat Chorus 

Ohhh. There's a lying in your silence. Tell me where did Johnny go? 
Ohhh. There's a lying in your silence. Tell me where did Johnny go? 
Sometimes I think I hear him calling out my name 
Sometimes I wonder if maybe we're to blame 
It's been a year now and a lot of things have changed 
But I keep thinking about Johnny. I keep turning to that page. 
Where did he go I want to know, Where did he go I want to know? 
Ohhh. There's a lying in your silence. Tell me where did Johnny go? 
Ohhh. There's a lying in your silence. Tell me where did Johnny go?
