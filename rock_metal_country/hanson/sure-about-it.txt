Whoa
I'm definately sure,
That I'm not sure.
Whoa 

Sittin' on the corner of nowhere road.
Just between "I wish I could",
And "I don't know".
Rain is splashing up between
Her toes.
She doesn't know her own area code
She's the picture 
Of a heart of gold.
On the edge of depression and unknown.
And a picture
Of the wrong high road.
Now it's too late for
A fight or foe. 

Now she's lookin' at me to know.
The faucet's runnin'
And my car got towed. 

[chorus]
I'm sure about it.
I'm definately sure,
That I do surely doubt it
I wish that I could say 
That I was sure about it.
I'm definately sure,
That I'm not sure.
Whoa. 

Did you see the man
With the cocaine load
It's on sale for the price of his soul
And a man with a long trench coat
Wish I could hide in a big black hole.
Seeing all your brains infold.
And you're crawling
Down a long, long road.
Feeling for a box named home
All you're missing is
A heart they stole.
They're lookin' at me to know.
My heart is pumpin'
And my feet got cold. 

I'm sure about it.
I'm definately sure,
That I do surely doubt it
I wish that I could say 
That I was sure about it.
I'm definately sure,
That I'm not sure.
Yeah.
I'm definately sure,
That I'm not
Yeah
Sure.
I'm sure that I'm not
Sure.
You know, oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh huh. 

Sittin' on the corner of nowhere road.
Just between "I wish I could",
And "I don't know".
There's a man with a long trench coat.
Wish I could hide in a big black hole. 

They're lookin' at me to know.
My heart is pumpin'
And my feet got cold. 

I'm sure about it.
I'm definately sure,
That I do surely doubt it
I wish that I could say 
That I was sure about it.
I'm definately sure,
That I'm not sure.
Yeah.
I'm definately sure,
That I'm not sure about it.
I'm definately sure,
That I do surely doubt it
I wish that I could say 
That I was sure about it.
I'm definately sure,
That I'm not sure about it.
Yeah.
I'm definately sure,
That I'm not sure
That I'm not
Yeah.
You know, oh yeah.
I'm definately sure,
That I'm not sure
Oh yeah.
