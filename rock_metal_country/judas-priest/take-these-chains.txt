I move away it don't do me no good
Three thousand miles don't help like I thought it would.
Help me, I'm beggin' you please.
You've got the power down on my knees
Give me some kind of life.
Leave me be.
Take these chains off
Take 'em off of my heart
Reach out to me, as if from the grave
I tried to run but I'm tied to you like a slave.
It's my fault for loving you so
You were so precious, how could I know.
You turned mean overnight
Poor poor me.
I don't owe you anything
Why don't you get out of my life.
Through it all the memories cling
And I can't sleep at night.
