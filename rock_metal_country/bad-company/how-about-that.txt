Last night, when the moon was new, I couldn't sleep, I was thinkin' of you
And how much I need ya, how about that
I act like I'm tougher than steel
With a heart like a stone, but you know it ain't real
I need you baby, how about that, hey
Oooh, how about that
I used to spend my life on the town, it took your lovin' to turn me around
I'm crazy about you, how about that
People used to tell ya I'm a crazy fool
But you taught me more than I could learn in school, I say
I really need ya, baby, how about that
If ever you need time and space
Don't run away, just tell me face to face, yeah
Oooh, how about that, how 'bout that, oooh, how about that, baby
Oooh, how about that, yeah alright, oh baby
Solo
When I think back of how it used to be, before we met it's just a mystery
I can't live without you, no, how about that
And you got my heart and you got my soul
Ooh you got my whole life under control
Looks like we made it, yeah, how about that, ooh yeah
And everytime I see your face, it lightens up the whole damn place
Yeah, I wanna see this whole thing through
Yeah, there's nothing I won't do for you, oh yeah
Oooh, how about that, how 'bout it, baby
Oooh, how about that, yeah, t-tell me
Oooh, how about that, how 'bout it, baby, oooh, yeah
Last night, when the moon was new
I couldn't sleep, I was there, lookin' at you
Yeah I'm glad that I found you, how about that, hey
Everytime I see your face, it lightens up the whole damn place
Yeah, I wanna see this whole thing through
Yeah, I wanna spend my life with you, oh yeah
Oooh, how about that, hey, how 'bout it baby
Oooh, how about that, t-tell me
Oooh, how about that, tell me baby
Oooh, how about that, baby yeah

Oooh, yeah how about that, oh, oh...
