Dead as dead can be, my doctor tells me
But I just can't believe him, ever the optimistic one
I'm sure of your ability to become my perfect enemy
Wake up and face me, don't play dead cause maybe
Someday I will walk away and say, You disappoint me,
Maybe you're better off this way

Leaning over you here, cold and catatonic
I catch a brief reflection of what you could and might have been
It's your right and your ability 
To becomemy perfect enemy

Wake up we'll catch you and face me come one now, 
Don't play dead don't play dead 
Cause maybe because maybe
Someday I'll someday I'll walk away and say, You disappoint me,
Maybe you're better off this way

Maybe you're better off this way
Maybe you're better off this way
Maybe you're better off this way
You're better of this; you're better off this;
Maybe you're better off!

Wake up can't you and face me come on now, 
Don't play dead don't play dead
Cause maybe because maybe
Someday I'll someday I'll walk away and say, You fucking disappoint me!
Maybe you're better off this way

Go ahead and play dead
I know that you can hear this
Go ahead and play dead
Why can't you turn and face me?
Why can't you turn and face me?
Why can't you turn and face me?
Why can't you turn and face me? 
You fucking disappoint me!

Passive aggressive bullshit
