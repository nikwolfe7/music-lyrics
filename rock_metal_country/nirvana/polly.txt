Polly wants a cracker. 
Think I should get off her first. 
I think she wants some water. 
To put out the blow torch. 

[Chorus]
It isn't me. 
We have some seed. 
Let me clip. 
Your dirty wings. 
Let me take ride. 
Don't hurt yourself. 
I want some help. 
To help myself.
I've got some rope.
You have been told. 
I promise you. 
I have been true. 
Let me take a ride. 
Don't hurt yourself. 
I want some help. 
To help myself.

Polly wants a cracker. 
Maybe she would like more food. 
She asks me to untie her. 
A chase would be nice for a few.

[Chours]...

Polly says her back hurts. 
And she's just as bored as me. 
She caugh me off my guard. 
It amazes me, the will of instinct.

[Chorus]...
