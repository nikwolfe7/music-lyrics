Like to take a cement fix 
Be a standing cinema. 
Dress my friends up just for show
See them as they really are. 

Put a peephole in my brain 
Two New Pence to have a go. 
Like to be a gallery 
Put you all inside my show. 

Andy Warhol, looks a scream, 
Hang him on my wall. 
Andy Warhol, silver screen 
Can't tell them apart at all.

Andy walking, Andy tired, 
Andy take a little snooze. 
Tie him up when he fast asleep, 
Send him on a pleasant cruise. 

When he wakes up on the beach
Be sure to think of me and you.
To think and paint, to think about glue, 
What a boring thing to do.
