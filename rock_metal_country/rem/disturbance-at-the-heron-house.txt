They're going wild,  the call came in 
At early morning pre-dawn, then 
 The followers of chaos out of control 
They're numbering the monkeys 
The monkeys and the monkeys,  
The followers of chaos out of control 

 They're meeting at the monument,  
The call came in the monument 
To liberty and honor under the honor roll 
 They've gathered up the cages the cages and courageous,  
The followers of chaos out of control 

The call came in to Party Central 
 Meeting of the green and simple,  
Try to tell us something we don't know 

 Disturbance at the Heron House  
A stampede at the monument 
To liberty and honor under the honor roll 
The gathering of grunts and greens 
Cogs and grunts and hirelings 
A meeting of a mean idea to hold 
 When feeding time has come and gone 
They'll lose the heart and head for home 
Try to tell us something we don't know  

Everyone allowed, Everyone allowed
