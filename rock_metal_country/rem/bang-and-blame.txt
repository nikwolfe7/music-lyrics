If you could see yourself now, baby 
It's not my fault 
You used to be so in control 
You're going to roll right over this one 
Just roll me over, let me go 
You're laying blame 
Take this as no, no, no, no, no 

You bang, bang, bang, bang and bang, 
Blame, blame, blame 
You bang, bang, bang, bang and bang, 
It's not my thing so let it go. 

If you could see yourself now baby, 
The tables have turned 
The whole world hinges on your swings 
Your secret life of indiscreet discretion 
I'd turn the screw and leave the screen, 
Don't point your finger, 
You know that's not my thing 

You came to bang, bang, bang, bang and bang, 
Blame, blame, blame 
You bang, bang, bang, bang and bang, 
It's not my thing so let it go. 

You've got a little worry, 
I know it all too well, 
I've got your number, 
But so does every kiss-and-tell 
Who dares to cross your threshold, 
Or happens on your way, 
Stop laying blame. 
You know that's not my thing. 

You know that's not my thing, 
You came to bang, bang, bang, bang and bang, 
Blame, blame, blame 
You bang, bang, bang, bang and bang, 
It's not my thing so let it go. 
You bang, bang, bang, bang and bang, 
Blame, blame, blame 
You bang, bang, bang, bang and bang, 
It's not my thing so let it go. 

You kiss on me, tug on me, rub on me, jump on me, 
You bang on me, beat on me, hit on me, let go on me, 
You let go on me.
