Look up, what do you see 
All of you and all of me 
Fluorescent and starry 
Some of them, they surprise 

The bus ride, I went to write this, 4:00 a.m. 
This letter 
Fields of poppies, little pearls 
All the boys and all the girls sweet-toothed 
Each and every one a little scary 
I said your name 

I wore it like a badge of teenage film stars 
Hash bars, cherry mash and tinfoil tiaras 
Dreaming of Maria Callas 
Whoever she is 
This fame thing, I don't get it 
I wrap my hand in plastic to try to look through it 
Maybelline eyes and girl-as-boy moves 
I can take you far 
This star thing, I don't get it 

I'll take you over, there 
I'll take you over, there 
Aluminum, tastes like fear 
Adrenaline, it pulls us near 

I'll take you over 
It tastes like fear, there 
I'll take you over 

Will you live to 83 
Will you ever welcome me 
Will you show me something that nobody else has seen 
Smoke it, drink 
Here comes the flood 
Anything to thin the blood 
These corrosives do their magic slowly and sweet 
Phone, eat it, drink 
Just another chink 
Cuts and dents, they catch the light 
Aluminum, the weakest link 

I don't want to disappoint you 
I'm not here to anoint you 
I would lick your feet 
But is that the sickest move 
I wear my own crown and sadness and sorrow 
And who'd have thought tomorrow could be so strange 
My loss, and here we go again 

I'll take you over, there 
I'll take you over, there 
Aluminum, tastes like fear 
Adrenaline, it pulls us near 

I'll take you over 
It tastes like fear, there 
I'll take you over 

Look up, what do you see 
All of you and all of me 
Fluorescent and starry 
Some of them, they surprise 

I can't look it in the eyes 
Seconal, Spanish fly, absinthe, kerosene 
Cherry-flavored neck and collar 
I can smell the sorrow on your breath 
The sweat, the victory and sorrow 
The smell of fear, I got it 

I'll take you over, there 
I'll take you over, there 
Aluminum, tastes like fear 
Adrenaline, it pulls us near 

I'll take you over 
It tastes like fear, there 
I'll take you over 

Pulls us near 
Tastes like fear. 

Nearer, nearer 
Over, over, over, over 
Yeah, look over 
I'll take you there, oh, yeah 
I'll take you there 
Oh, over 
I'll take you there 
Over, let me 
I'll take you there.. 
There, there, baby, yeah
