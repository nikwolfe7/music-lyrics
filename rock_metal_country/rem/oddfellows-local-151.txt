Oddfellows local 151 behind the firehouse 
Where Peewee sits to prove a sage to teach 
Peewee gathered up his proof 
Reached up and scratched his head 
Fell down and hit the ground again 

Firehouse. Firehouse. 

Why do the heathens rage behind the firehouse 
Where Peewee sits upon the wall to preach 
This boy and girl that gather pearls 
Of wisdom falling from his mouth 
Wash off the blood, wash off the rum 

Firehouse. Firehouse.

Of wisdom falling from his mouth 
Wash off the blood, wash off the 151 

Firehouse. Firehouse.
