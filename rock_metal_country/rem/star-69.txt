you don't have to take the bar exam to see 
What you've done is ignoramus one oh three 
What've I got to hang my hat on 
You don't have a pot to pee in 
All this just to be your friend 
I was there until the end. 
Extortion and arson, petty larceny 

I know you called - I know you called - I know you called - 
I know you called - I know you called - I know you hung up my line 
Star sixty-nine 

I know all about the warehouse fire 
I know squirrelies didn't chew the wires 
3 people have my number 
The other 2 were with me. 
I don't like to tell-tell but I'm not your patsy. 
This time you have gone too far with me. 

I know you called - I know you called - I know you called - 
I know you called - I know you called - I know you hung up my line 
Star sixty-nine 

Why'd you put your quarter down on me 
This reads like some dork inside edition hard copy. 
I can't be your character witness 
I can't be your alibi 
Doorbell rings it's the FBI 
We learned spy versus spy 
You my friend, are guilty as can be. 

I know you called - I know you called - I know you called - 
I know you called - I know you called - I know you hung up my line
