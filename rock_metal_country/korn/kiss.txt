Some deny and search for things that never come around
Do I feel like a fool?
The places I have ran to all my life have disappeared
And I owe this all to you

I'm feeling like I'm sinking
And nothing's there to catch me, keep me breathing

What do I have to do?
Why can't this hurt be through?
I'm going head unto
Something I know I will fail
Why can't this kiss be true
Why won't you please let me through?
I don't understand why you always push me away

The last thing I would like to do before I go away
is cry there next to you next to you
Cry and talk about the good old days and where they've gone
And now how much I hate you

What do I have to do?
Why can't this hurt be through?
I'm going head unto
Something I know I will fail
Why can't this kiss be true
Why won't you please let me through?
I don't understand why you always push me away

I feel the blood drip off my body as it falls right there
on the ground
What am I now?

What am I now?
What am I now?

What do I have to do?
Why can't this hurt be through?
I'm going head unto
Something I know I will fail
Why can't this kiss be true
Why won't you please let me through?
I don't understand why you always push me away

Why you always push me away
Why you always push me away
Why you always push me away
Why you always push me away
Why you always push me away
Why you always push me away
Why you always push me away
Why you always push me away
