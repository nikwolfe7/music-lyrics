How did it start
Well, I dont know.
I just feel the craving.
I see the flesh and it smells fresh.
And it's just there for the taking.
These little girls they make me feel so god damn
exhilarated.
I feel them up, I can't give it up.
The pain that I'm just erasing. 
I tell my lies and I despise.
Every second I'm with you.
So I run away and you still stay.
So what the fuck is with you. 

Your feelings I can't help but rape them.
I'm sorry I don't feel the same.
My heart inside is constantly hating.
I'm sorry I just throw you away. 

I don't know why I'm so fucking cold
I dont know why it hurts me.
All I wanna do is get with you.
And make the pain go away.
Why do I have a conscience
All it does is fuck with me.
Why do I have this torment
All I want to do is fuck it away. 

I tell my lies and I despise.
Every second I'm with you.
So I run away and you still stay.
So what the fuck is with you. 

Your feelings I can't help but rape them.
I'm sorry I don't feel the same.
My heart inside is constantly hating.
I'm sorry I just throw you away. 

I just throw you away.
I just throw you away.
I just throw you away.
I just throw you away.
