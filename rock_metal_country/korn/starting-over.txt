Got to face your fear
lying on the floor
Step into nothing, what the hell am I here for?
So come on and play
Stab me in my heart
So long this time was wasted ripping me apart

We are the hurt inside your head
Lost in the void of what is dead
Constantly twisting things I said
Happiness is boring, need pain instead

It's starting over, starting over
Can't stand it's over, God is gonna take me out
My time is over, this time is over
Why is this over? God is gonna take me out

God is gonna take me out

Crawling on the floor
All around this space
Talking to myself
What is this thing I've got to face?
Walking through a door
Has it been a waste?
Going on and on thinking I could find my place

We are the hurt inside your head
Lost in the void of what is dead
Constantly twisting things I said
Happiness is boring, need pain instead

It's starting over, starting over
Can't stand it's over, God is gonna take me out
My time is over, this time is over
Why is this over? God is gonna take me out

God is gonna take me out God is gonna take me out
God is gonna take me out

You can't see
I'm torn away from you and everything that's
close to me
I cannot face the truth, it's nothing that
I believe
Just run away from me and thank me when you're
free from me
Come take me

Come take me
Come take me
Come take me
Come take me

Come take me We are the hurt inside your head
Lost in the void of what is dead
Come take me Constantly twisting things I said
Happiness is boring, need pain instead
Come take me We are the hurt inside your head
Lost in the void of what is dead
Come take me Constantly twisting things I said
Happiness is boring, need pain instead
