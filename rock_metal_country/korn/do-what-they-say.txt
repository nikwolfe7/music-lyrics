Walk away when you're angry
Brace yourself, there's nothing to gain
Old enough to know the outcome
More blood, it's always the same

Aren't we cool and aren't we calm
For facing death we run head-on
Aren't we cool and aren't we calm
For god we've suffered for so long

Do what they say
Or they take it away
I'd rather be dead then carry on

wait Bite your lip, don't be cursing
we must We musn't take God's name in vain
in vain Blunt your knife, pull the curtain
impulse Impulses you must refrain

Aren't we cool and aren't we calm
For facing death we run head-on
Aren't we cool and aren't we calm
For god we've suffered for so long

Do what they say
Or they take it away
I'd rather be dead then carry on

Somebody carry on with this burden
I can't remember anything
I can't be certain

Aren't we cool and aren't we calm
For facing death we run head-on

Do what they say
Or they take it away
I'd rather be dead then carry on
