I can't stand to let you in.
I'm just watching you.
And I don't know what to do.
Feeling like a fool inside.
Feeling all the hurt you hide.
Thought you were my friend.
Seems it never ends. 
I need somebody someone.
Can't somebody help me.
All I need is to be.
Loved just for me. 

Giving you this and that.
Giving gave nothing back.
It's all related to.
All the things I do.
Feeling like a fool inside.
Seeing all the things you tried.
I am nothing. 

I look I sign.
I need someone.
Inside to help me out.
With what I'm trying.
I'm crying, I'm frying.
In a pile of shit.
I'm dying.
I'm dying.
I'm dying 

I need somebody someone.
Somebody somebody.
Someone. 

I need somebody someone.
Somebody somebody.
Someone. 

Someone.
