I used to be so in control
But reality is losing its hold
Now I don't know where to begin
Just look at the state that I'm in
My mind is in total decay
I'm coming to take you away
There's nothing more that I can do 
This maniac's in love with you
Your biggest fear has just come true
This maniac's in love with you
This maniac's in love with you
This maniac, this maniac
My heart has been strapped in a straight jacket love
The therapy boys say it fits like glove
I'm grossing the line in my brain
The line between pleasure and pain
It takes all I've got to survive
This madness will eat me alive
There's nothing more that I can do 
This maniac's in love with you
Your biggest fear has just come true
There's nothing more that I can do
This maniac's in love with you
There's nothing more that I can do 
This maniac's in love with you
I'm all locked up inside of you
This maniac, this maniac
I just don't know where to begin
Just look at the state that I'm in
My mind is total decay
I'm coming to take you away
There's nothing more that you can do 
This maniac's in love with you
Your biggest fear has just come true
This maniac's in love with you
There's nothing more that you can do 
This maniac's in love with you
Your biggest fear has just come true
