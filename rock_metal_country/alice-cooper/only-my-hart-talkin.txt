Anybody's dream can fall apart
Anybody's mask can break
Couldn't tell you how I wanted you
Enough to make you want to stay
I never said the words out loud
I guess I couldn't get'em straight
Baby, give me one more chance
Before you walk away
It's only, only, only my heart talkin'
Yeah, it's only, only, only my heart talkin'
Saying things I never thought I'd say
Can't you hear me knocking
Tried to fool you but it wouldn't play
Cuz my heart it's talkin', it's talkin'
Baby, it's talkin'
Talkin'to you
Every time I take it to the edge
Every time I'm so afraid
Don't you know I cry my eyes out, babe
Every time you look away
Oh, I almost dropped a tear
But I caught it just in time
I'd say the things you want to hear
If you'd help me, help me, help me try
It's only, only, only my heart talkin'
Yeah, it's only, only, only my heart talkin'
Saying things I never thought I'd say
Can't you hear me knockin'
Tried to fool you but it wouldn't play
Cuz my heart it's talkin', it's talkin'
Baby, it's talkin'
Talkin'to you
Well, I don't want to hide away
Hide away without you, baby
Don't you go and run away
Come on and help me, baby
Just a little help, baby
