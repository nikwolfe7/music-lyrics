Fish / Marillion 
a Brief Encounter
A spider wanders aimlessly within the warmth of a shadow
Not the regal creature of border caves
But the poor, misguided, directionless familiar of some obscure Scottish poet
The mist crawls from the canal 
Like some primordial phantom of romance
To curl, under a cascade of neon pollen
While I sit tied to the phone like an expectant father
Your carnation will rot in a vase
b Lost Weekend
A train sleeps in a siding
The driver guzzles another can of lager, lager
To wash away the memories of a Friday night down at the club
She was a wallflower at sixteen, she'll be a wallflower at thirty four
Her mother called her beautiful
Her daddy said, ";A whore";
c Blue Angel
The sky was Bible black in Lyon, when I met the Magdalene
She was paralyzed in a streetlight
She refused to give her name
And a ring of violet bruises
They were pinned upon her arm
Two hundred francs for sanctuary and she led me by the hand
To a room of dancing shadows where all the heartache disappears 
And from glowing tongues of candles I heard her whisper in my ear
'J'entend ton coeur', 'J'entend ton coeur'
I can hear your heart, I can hear your heart, I can hear your heart
Hear your heart
I hear your heart
d Misplaced Rendezvous
It's getting late, for scribbling and scratching on the paper
Something's gonna give under this pressure, and the cracks are already beginning to show
It's too late
The weekend career girl never boarded the plane
They said this could never happen again
Oh, so wrong, so wrong
This time it seems to be another misplaced rendezvous
This time, it's looking like another misplaced rendezvous
With you
The parallel of you, you
e Windswept Thumb
On the outskirts of nowhere
On the ringroad to somewhere
On the verge of indecision
I'll always take the roundabout way
Waiting on the rain
For I was born with a habit, from a sign
The habit of a windswept thumb, and the sign of the rain
Rain on me, rain
It's started raining
