Now I lay me down not to sleep
I just get tangled in the sheets
I swim in sweat three inches deep
I just lay back and claim defeat

Chapter read and lesson learned
I turned the lights off while she burned
So while she's three hundred degrees
I throw the sheets off and I freeze

Lids down, I count sheep
I count heartbeats
The only thing that counts is
that I won't sleep
I countdown, I look around

Who needs sleep
well you're never gonna get it
Who needs sleep
tell me what's that for
Who needs sleep
be happy with what you're getting
There's a guy who's been awake
since the Second World War

My hands are locked up tight in fists
My mind is racing, filled with lists
of things to do and things I've done
Another sleepless night's begun

Lids down, I count sheep
I count heartbeats
The only thing that counts is
that I won't sleep
I countdown, I look around

Who needs sleep
well you're never gonna get it
Who needs sleep
tell me what's that for
Who needs sleep
be happy with what you're getting
There's a guy who's been awake
since the Second World War

Who needs sleep
well you're never gonna get it
Who needs sleep
tell me what's that for
Who needs sleep
be happy with what you're getting
There's a guy who's been awake
since the Second World War

There's so much joy in life,
so many pleasures all around
But the pleasure of insomnia
is one I've never found
With all life has to offer,
there's so much to be enjoyed
But the pleasures of insomnia
are ones I can't avoid

Lids down, I count sheep
I count heartbeats
The only thing that counts is
that I won't sleep
I countdown, I look around

Hala Hala Hala

Who needs sleep
well you're never gonna get it
Who needs sleep
tell me what's that for
Who needs sleep
be happy with what you're getting
There's a guy who's been awake
since the Second World War
