I cannot sleep at night
That's what the day is for anyway
And as the clock strikes midnight
I hear ";THEM"; dancing at the graves
singing to My mind
killing the pain . . . sleepless nights . . . sleepless nights
I cannot sleep at night
That's what the day is for anyway
And as the clock strikes midnight
only ";THEY"; can let us meet
even though she's dead now
I gotta see her again . . . sleepless nights . . . sleepless nights
I cannot sleep at night
I will do anything to see Missy again
";Then let us make You an eternal deal
You will attend to the graves
You'll give us the house back and keep in mind
that we only come here at night";.
So we made the deal under the starry night and
";AMON"; belongs to ";THEM"; now . . . 
I feel the dawn coming My way
And as the sun breaks up the dark
I can't hear ";THEM"; dance no more
There's no voices
killing the pain . . . pain . . . pain
