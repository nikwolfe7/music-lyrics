Grandma' welcome home... You have 
been gone for far too long 
Is this a dream, are You really back? 
Let me help You out of the chair... 
Grandma' 
Let me touch You, let me feel... Ahhh 
Grandma' take a look 
What do You think of the house and 
the silvery moon? 
We are going to repaint the front door 
soon 
Let me help You out of the chair... 
Grandma' 
Let me touch You, let me feel... Ahhh 
Wait till You see Your room up in the 
attic 
Prepared just like You said, without a 
bed 
You will find Your rocking chair and 
the tea pot that Missy found 
Let me help You out of the chair... 
Grandma' 
There is someone waiting for You, 
now come along 
Missy and Mother, they are dying to 
meet You 
How strange... she's spoken no word... 
I wonder Grandma'! Are You all right? 
Grandma' what was it like to be on 
that holiday site 
";Oh it could have been worse but 
with ";THEM"; by my side 
In the twilight ";THEY"; sang all the old 
lullabies"; 
Grandma' who are ";THEY";... ";never 
mind You dirty little brat"; 
";Let us go inside, something's on 
";THEIR"; mind 
";THEY"; are still alive, can You feel 
";THEIR"; eyes 
Can You feel ";THEIR"; eyes? 
Now that You are stuck with me You 
better be my friend.
