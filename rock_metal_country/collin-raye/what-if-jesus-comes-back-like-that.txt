He came to town on an old freight train
He jumped off in the pouring rain
Everybody says he's insane
Just a low down no account hobo
He made his bed beneath the county bridge
The city folks said hey, that's not his
They signed a petition they're gonna get rid
Of that low down no account white trash
What if Jesus comes back like that
On an old freight train in a hobo hat
Will we let him in or turn our back
What if Jesus comes back like that
Oh what if Jesus comes back like that
She was born into drug abuse
She couldn't help what her mama used
It wasn't like she got to choose
Now she's layin' there all alone
Got a monkey on her back
The nurses say they never saw a smile like that
Doctor says she might stand a chance
If somebody takes her home
What if Jesus comes back like that
Two months early and hooked on crack
Will we let him in or turn our back
What if Jesus comes back like that
Oh what if Jesus comes back like that
Nobody said life is fair
We've all got a cross to bear
When it gets a little hard to care
Just think about him hanging there
He came to town on a cold dark night
A single star his only light
The baby born that silent night
A manger for his bed
What if Jesus comes back like that
Where will he find out hearts are at
Will he let us in or turn his back
What if Jesus comes back like that
Will he cry when he sees where our hearts are at
Will he let us in or turn his back
What if Jesus comes back like that
Hey what if Jesus comes back like that
