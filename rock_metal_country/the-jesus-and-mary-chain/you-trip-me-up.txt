sung by Jim
Sometimes
I walk sideways
To avoid you
When I've annoyed you
Love's like
The mighty ocean
When it's frozen
That is your heart
What would I be
If I could free
I couldn't even walk
You trip me up
But you break me in two
And you throw me away
And you spit on my head
You trip me up
And you break me in two
And you throw me away
Knock me on my back
I'll send a heart attack
I'd like to trip you up
I'd like to trip you up
I'd like to trip you up
I'd like to trip you up
I'd like to trip
I'd like to trip
I'd like to trip you up
I'd like to trip you up
