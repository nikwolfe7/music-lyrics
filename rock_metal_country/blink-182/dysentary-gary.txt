Got a lotta heart ache 
He's a fuckin' weasel 
His issues make my mind ache 
Wanna make a deal 

'Cause I love your little motions 
You do with your pigtails 
What a nice creation 
Worth another night in jail 

He's a player, diarrhea giver 
Tried to grow his hair out, friends were listening to Slayer 
I'd like to find him Friday night 
Hanging out with mom, trying on his father's tights 

Life just sucks, I lost the one 
I'm giving up, she found someone 
There's plenty more 
Girls are such a drag 

So all you little ladies 
Be sure to choose the right guys 
You'll come back to me maybe 
I'll shower you with lies 

Got a lotta heart ache 
He's a fuckin' weasel 
Decisions make my mind ache 
Wanna make a deal 

Ease away the problems and the pain 
The girl chose the guy that makes you wanna kick and scream 
All along, you wish that she would stay 
Fuck the guy that took and ran away, yeah 

He's a player, diarrhea giver 
Tried to grow his hair out, friends were listening to Slayer 
I'd like to find him Friday night 
Hanging out with mom and trying on his father's tights 

Life just sucks, I lost the one 
I'm giving up, she found someone 
There's plenty more 
Girls are such a drag 

Fuck this place, I lost the war 
I hate you all, your mom's a whore 
Where's my dog? 
'Cause girls are such a drag
