Breathing deeply, walking backwards,
finding strength to call and ask her
Rollercoaster favorite ride,
let me kiss you one last time

Leave me standing here, act like I'm not around
The coaster will probably never clear, can I please go home now
I had that dream about you again
Where I wait outside until you let me in,
and there I stay

Lay beside me and listen at the wall, 
we'll keep on lying until the summer comes
I had that dream about you again, 
where you drive my car right off the fucking cliff

And now I`m breathing deeply, walking backwards,
finding strength to call and ask her,
Rollercoaster favorite ride,
let me kiss you one last time

Make me promise that I will never tell,
all I remember's the way her bedroom smelled
I had that dream about you again,
where I wait outside until you let me in

And now I'm breathing deeply,walking backwards,
finding strength to call and ask her
Rollercoaster favorite ride,
let me kiss you one last time good night 

Good night
