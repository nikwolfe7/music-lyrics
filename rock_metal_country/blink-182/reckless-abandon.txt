On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong, this is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song to lead you on

I learned a lot today,
not sure if  I'll get laid,
not sure if  I'll fail or pass,
kissed every girl in class

Everybody would waste it all,
to have a summer that they could call,
memory thats full of fun,
fucked up, when it's all done

On and on, reckless abandon
Somethings wrong, this is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song to lead you on
And break the truth with more bad news
we left a scar, size extra large

Sip a drink of the alcohol 
end up kneeling in bathroom stalls 
Eyes are red and my movements slow 
too high, got vertigo
He took a shit in the bathroom tub,
and fed the dog the brownie drugs
Tried hard to not get caught,
he fucked a chick in a parking lot

On and on, reckless abandon
Somethings wrong, this is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song to lead you on
And break the truth with more bad news
we left a scar, size extra large

Break a window and bust a wall,
making fun of your friends mom
Turn the music up way too loud,
Charge the pizza to the house
Everybody would waste it all,
to have a summer that they could call
Memory thats full of fun,
fucked up when it's all done

On and on, reckless abandon
Somethings wrong, this is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song to lead you on
And break the truth with more bad news
we left a scar, size extra large
