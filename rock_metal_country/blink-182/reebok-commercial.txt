You are better than me
girls money and everything that I
try to compete with you
but you beat me at everything I do

I see in you
the things that I would like to be
but I'm different from you
so you will have to be like me

I cannot be bought
my personality is what I choose
I was brought up without a silver cup
I won't covet the things owned by you

For all the world
material things are now more and more
jealousy for you and me
I won't covet the things owned by your store

I cannot be bought
my personality is what I choose
I was brought up without a silver cup
I won't covet the things owned by you
