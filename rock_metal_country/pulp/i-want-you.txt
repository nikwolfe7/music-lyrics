Hey, / you can look, you can look just like anyone else 
if that's what you want to do. / I, 
I could laugh, I could laugh in your face if I want / oh, but I'm not going to.

When we met last week on Saturday, 
[backing vocals:] ba ba ba ba 
I couldn't make a sentence, / I couldn't even say / what I meant to say: 
that I want you / it doesn't hurt to say I want you, I need you 
I never thought I'd say I need you, I'll keep you, 
oh yes I'll keep you and I'll throw myself away, away, away, 
and I'll break you / because I lose myself inside you, I'll make you 
fit in the space that I provide you, I'll take you, 
oh yes, I'll take you just to push you far away, away, away. 
Yes, / yes, you're all, yes you're all that I ever desire, 
still I'll kill you in the end. 
When, / when it seems, when it seems that it's getting too soft, 
when you lapse into a friend, 
[backing vocals:] ba ba ba ba 
There's someone just behind the door 
[backing vocals:] ba ba ba ba 
so don't betray your feelings, / no don't talk anymore, 
never dare to say / that I want you 
it doesn't hurt to say I want you, I need you 
I never thought I'd say I need you, I'll keep you, 
oh yes I'll keep you and I'll throw myself away, away, away, 
and I'll break you / because I lose myself inside you, I'll make you 
fit in the space that I provide you, I'll take you, 
oh yes, I'll take you just to push you far away, away, away. 
Now, / now we come, now we come to the end of it all, 
see it squirming, almost dead. 
No, / you can't leave, you can't leave it to die here in pain. 
You've got to stamp upon it's head. 
[backing vocals:] ba ba ba ba 
I'll go out and you'll stay home 
[backing vocals:] ba ba ba ba 
facing up to living, / living on your own, / and I'll curse my pride, 
curse my pride, / curse my stupid pride / because I want you 
it doesn't hurt to say I want you, I need you 
I never thought I'd say I need you, I'll keep you, 
oh yes I'll keep you and I'll throw myself away, away, away, and I'll break you 
because I lose myself inside you, I'll make you 
fit in the space that I provide you, I'll take you, 
oh yes, I'll take you just to push you far away, away, away.
