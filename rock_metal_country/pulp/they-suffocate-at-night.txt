His body loved her, his mind was set on other things
Keep your face out of sight and your thoughts to yourself
And this went on for several nights festering in silence, growing in the dark
And this they saw as love. 
Love
So sad to see
They suffocate at night
Oh this they saw as love 
Love
So sad to see to see it slowly die
She met his wishes, he found that he had changed his mind
Now the fit is too tight and the bedroom too warm
The days are filled with things to do
Night-time lies so hollow and memories betray
Oh memories of love
Love
So sad to see
They suffocate at night
Those memories of love
Love
So sad to see to see it slowly die
Two years have passed, two years of emptiness inside 
And the grey skies above just show how far I went wrong
I wonder if she's living there the way that I recall
The way I'll always think of you
And when I think of you I think of love
Love
So sad to see
They suffocate at night
You know I think of love 
Love 
So sad to see to see it slowly die
I wrote you a letter
I threw it away
I wrote you a letter
I threw it away
I need her
I know I don't need her
I need her
Oh Oh-oh... 
Dadalala...
