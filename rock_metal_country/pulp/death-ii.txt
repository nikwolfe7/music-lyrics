Oh uh-uh-uh Oh
Hey Oh now the lonely nights begin and there is nowhere left to go
But watch my spirit melt away, down at the D-I-S-C-O
I must have died a thousand times
The next day, I was still alive
And I still believe in you
Yes I do
Let's do it now
No I was not crushed, I did not cry
You know that everything's O.K.
It's just sometimes I wake at night
All alone and see your face
Oh, thousands feel the same but the night-time falls away
Oh no but still sometimes I feel oh sometimes I feel like Jesus Christ now
Hey I feel this night will never end and I will never see the day
Oh I was nothing when you came
I'm no-one now you've gone away
Oh all I do is just O.K.
All of my nights, and all of my days
Oh-oh if you came home right now
I'd run away
Oh run away now
O.K. now
Alright You can go out and make love to whoever, or whatever you like babe
So I go out and fill my eyes with other women
Oh they look good to me and I think that I might kiss them
Oh now it's two a.m. and I'm still stood here waiting
So I go home and wonder why I bother going
Yeah every week turns out the same the sun, the wind, the snow, the rain
Oh no but still sometimes I feel
Oh sometimes I feel like Jesus Christ now 
Hey I feel this night will never end and I will never see the day
Oh I was nothing when you came
I'm no-one now you've gone away
Oh all I do is just O.K.
All of my nights, and all of my days
Oh-oh if you came home right now I'd run away
I can't believe it
I can't remember your face anymore or the sound of your voice 
Or any touch of your skin is a legend
By the way, did I tell you that I loved you
Oh if I didn't I'm so sorry
You know I I really, I really meant to tell you it's O.K. there's no need to hurry
But the bed is full of memories, full of memories of you
Oh I've tried to get them out but but there's nothing I can do 
Oh if I knew the moon I'd ask him
Shine his light in through your window and send your body home to me today
Hey I feel this night will never end and I will never see the day 
Oh I was nothing when you came
I'm no-one now you've gone away
Oh all I do is O.K.
All of my nights, and all of my days
Oh-oh if you came home right now
I'd run away
Run away Run away.
