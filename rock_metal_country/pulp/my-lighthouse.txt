Come up to my lighthouse for I have something I wish to say 
It can wait for a moment; well in fact / it can wait all day 
I just wanted to bring you up here so you could have the chance to see 
the beauty of this situation that / you could share with me 
It may seem strange / to talk of love and then lighthouses 
It's not strange / to me 
Hey / All alone / you and I in our high tower 
That's the way / to be 
Some laugh at my lighthouse they say it's just an ivory tower 
But I don't mind because I know / their envy grows by the hour 
See I have a purpose up here to guide the ships upon their way 
All this is mine; it could be yours too / what do you say 
It may seem strange / to talk of love and then lighthouses 
It's not strange / to me / Hey / All alone / you and I in our high tower 
That's the way / to be / Hehehey hey.
