You know sometimes ... when we're lying together ... 
and I know you're asleep ... 
I can hear the soft sound of your breathing ... so I get up ... 
and I go to the window ...
Outside ... I can see all the houses ... 
Curtains shut tight against the night ... asleep beneath the roof-tiles ... 
And as I stand here ... I wonder ... I wonder how many more times ... 
I'm gonna come here ...
I wonder how many more times ... I'm gonna lie here ... 
And most of all ... most of all I wonder ... 
I wonder what it means ... I just wanna know what it means ... 
So I woke her ... and we went walking through the sleeping town ... 
down deserted streets ...
Frozen gardens grey in the moonlight ... fences ... down to the canal ...
Creeping slowly past the cooling towers ... 
Deserted factories ... looking for an adventure ... 
I wandered the streets calling your name ... 
Jumping walls ... hoping to see a light in the window ... 
Let me in ... let me come in ... let me in tonight ... 
Oh I see you shivering in the garden ... silver goose-flesh in the moonlight ... 
She's balancing ... there are so many others ... with unbroken eyes ... 
No cellulite afternoons ... 
And she is balancing ... balancing on the edge of ugliness tonight ... 
She is balancing ... good God!
My legendary girlfriend, she is crying tonight
Oh no she doesn't feel right
She's got no-one to hold
Her love is a sham
He is dancing somewhere
Oh no he doen't care oh well, he'll never know
Jump ... touch my hair ... 
I wanna ... I don't care ... 'cos tonight ... 
We could, maybe we ... maybe we can touch the sky ... 
Do you think that we can ... 
Do you think that we can ... touch the sky ... please ... 
I know ... I know it's not forever ... but tonight I don't care ... 
Your skin so pale in the moonlight ... 
and the way your lips swell up when you're asleep ...
Nothing else matters ... do you know how much I want you ... 
Can you feel how much I want you ... Oh
Pitsmoor Woman
Oh let oh let me in tonight
My legendary girlfriend, she is crying tonight
Oh no she doesn't feel right
She's got no-one to hold 
Her love is a sham 
He is dancing somewhere
Oh no he doen't care oh well, he'll never know
And all the stars came out tonight and the moon came on it's face
It shone right though the clothes she wore
It shone right through the dress she wore
Good God ... Oh, y'know ... listen ... listen ... please ... oh ... 
I just wanna ... I just wanna... ... 
He falls to sleep again ... no cheese tonight ... she knows
My legendary girlfriend, she is crying tonight
Oh no she doesn't feel right 
She's got no-one to hold
Her love is a sham 
He is dancing somewhere 
Oh no he doen't care oh well, he'll never know 
And all the stars came out tonight and the moon came on it's face
It shone right through the dress she wore 
It shone right through the clothes she wore
And the stars and the moon
And the stars all came down today
Oh please love me tonight
Good God now!
