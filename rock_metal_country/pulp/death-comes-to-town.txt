Ah ah ah ah ah... / Tonight's the night / Open your door and I'll come inside 
Don't be afraid, it willbe alright / I will change your whole life tonight 
and you're so beautiful / too beautiful for this dead-end world 
I'm taking you to a better place / oh, far away from this stupid race, oh 
Come with me / for ever / and ever / please come with me / for ever 
No, don't let me down / oh, don't make me cry 
Lie in my arms / and be mine tonight / Do it 
Oh, did I tell you / that there was no need to be afraid 
Oh, you've got such a beautiful body 
Oh, you'll make such a beautiful body 
I smoke these yellow-lit cul-de-sacs at night 
You hear my foot-step on your bedroom stair 
and I will take the first one in every house in town 
I'll take your sisters and I'll lay them down / I'll lay them down 
Tonight! 
Mother mother 
Father father 
Brother brother 
Take them all a- 
Ba ba ba ba... 
Make you mine / I want your body 
Mother mother 
Father father 
Brother brother 
The wind the wind 
Streets streets 
Those girls girls 
I walked into town town town.
