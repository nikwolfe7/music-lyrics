She's dying, everybody came to see
She's falling and I know I'll never see her face again
And I don't really know just why she's leaving
All she ever said was she just had to go
And I watch her as she walks away from me
Yeah, I can see her then I know that in a moment she'll be gone
Yeah, she'll be gone and and then I'll say
"You've got to understand. She's not really breathing no not at all
Those years of endless rain, they just washed her away."
Oh and I know she's leaving
Yeah she's going for good 
Oh and I'd love to go with you but I never would face it 
You've blown it this time round
Now I understand just why she's leaving
Oh if she'd have hung around with me
Well you know she'd never go, no nonono
Oh and I know she's leaving
Yeah, she's going for good and I'd love to go with you but I never would
Oh and I know she's leaving
Yeah, she's going for good and I'd love to go with you oh but I never would
No I never would
No I never would
No I never would
Oh no Dadadada dadada...
She's never coming back
Face it
She's gone
Oh Lalalala lalala... 
No I never would
No I never would.
