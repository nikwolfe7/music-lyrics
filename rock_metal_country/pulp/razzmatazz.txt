The trouble with your brother, he's always sleeping with your mother
And I know that your sister missed her time again this month 
Am I talking too fast or are you just playing dumb 
If you want I can write it down
It should matter to you but aren't you the one with your razzmatazz 
and the nights on the town
Oh-oh-oh Oh you knew it and you blew it didn't you babe
I was lying when I asked you to stay now no-one's gonna care
If you don't call them when you said 
And he's not coming round tonight to try and talk you into bed 
And all those stupid little things they ain't working
No they aren't working at all oh
You started getting fatter three weeks after I left you
Now you're going with some kid looks like some bad comedian
Are you gonna go out, are you sitting at home eating boxes of Milk Tray
Watch TV on your own, aren't you the one with your razzmatazz 
and your nights on the town 
Oh-oh-oh And your father wants to help you doesn't he babe 
But your mother wants to put you away
Now no-one's gonna care if you don't call them when you said 
And he's not coming round tonight to try and talk you into bed 
And all those stupid little things they ain't working
Oh they aren't working at all
Oh well I saw you at the doctor's waiting for a test
You tried to look like some kind of heiress but your face is such a mess 
And now you're going to a party and you're leaving on your own
Oh I'm sorry but didn't you say that things go better with a little bit of razzamatazz 
Na na nana na na na... and now no-one's gonna care if you don't call them when you said 
And he's not coming round tonight to try and talk you into bed
Now it's half past ten in the evening and you wish that you were dead
'cos all those stupid little things 
No they ain't working, oh they aren't working at all.
