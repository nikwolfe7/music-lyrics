There's not much time for talking, / all your friends are / going to walk away. 
If there was time for talking / all too soon you'd be / lost for things to say. 
Don't you know she could break you, / every bone that's inside of you 
Then again she might make you / everything that you want her to, 
and if you could walk away, / where would you go / anyway 
And if you've still got the chance, I know you know / you'll stay, / stay. 
I don't need your excuses; / are you tired of / trying to stay on top 
so just lie back and enjoy it / and save your tears for / when the kissing stops
oh, you know it's got to stop. 
Don't you know she could break you, / every bone that's inside of you 
Then again she might make you / everything that you want her to, 
and if you could walk away, / where would you go / anyway 
And if you've still got the chance, I know you know / you'll stay, / stay. 
Oh, you'll stay, / oh, you'll stay. 
Don't you know she could break you, / every bone that's inside of you 
Then again she might make you / everything that you want her to, 
and if you could walk away, / where would you go / anyway 
And if you've still got the chance, I know you know / you'll stay, / stay. 
Oh, you'll stay, / oh, you'll stay. 
Oh, you'll stay, / oh, you'll stay, 
oh, you'll stay, / oh, you'll stay, 
oh, you'll stay.
