It's a little bit fUnny Lord, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money but, boy, if I did
I'd buy a big mansion where we both could live

If, if, if I was a sculpture Lord, honey, but then again, no
then again no, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelin' show
I know it's not much, I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
You gave me a gift Lord, and I'm gonNA sing it for you
And you can tell everybody that this is your song
this is your song
It may be a quite, quite simple, but that's how it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
What I wrote down in words, words
How wonderful life is when you're in the world, world, world

If, if, if, if I was on a rooftop
I'd kick off my shoes kick off my shoes , kick my shoes off
I'll write a few verses and then I get the blues
But the sun's been quite, quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you and people like me
I wanna, I wanna keep turnin' on

So excuse me, so excuse me
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do Lord
these things I do Lord
You see, you see I've forgotten if they're green or blue
Anyway the thing is, anyway the thing is, what I really mean
You've got the sweetest eyes, you've got the sweetest eyes
The clearest eyes I've ever seen, I hope you got back

I hope you, I hope you got back and tell everybody
That this is your song this is your song
It may be quite, quite simple, but now that's how it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
But I wrote down in words Lord, words
I'm doin' it for how wonderful it is when you're in the world, world, world

If, if, if, if I sat upon a rooftop I'd kick off my shoes, oh yeah
kick off my shoes, kick my shoes off
I'll write a few verses and then I get the blues
But the sun's been quite, quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you, people like me
I wanna, wanna keep turnin' on, so escuse me, so escuse me

So escuse me forgetting, but these things I do
these things I do Lord
You see, you see I've forgotten if they're green or blue, baby
And anyway the thing is, anyway the thing is, what I really mean
You are the sweetest eyes, the sweetest eyes
The sweetest eyes I've ever seen

I want you to go back, go back and and tell everybody
That Billy Paul's got a song Billy Paul's got a song
I'm, I'm gonna sit upon a, a rooftop and kick off my shoes
I'm gonna write it write it, write it write it, write it write it
I might come out with the Gospel Gospel, the blues blues,
The jazz jazz, the rock and roll

I'm gonna, got to, got to write me a simple song for everybody
Because this is my song this is my song
It may be quite, quite simple but that's the way it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
What I wrote down in words, words
You come back, you try to try again, try again

Tell everybody that Billy Paul's got a song
Billy Paul's got a song
It may be quite, quite simple but that's how it's done, baby
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
what I wrote down in words
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it ooooh
Get back, get, got, oh no
