[Timbaland]
I'll be with you on your way to work
When your car turns on you'll probably hear me yeah
You can't run your car without me without me
Want a deal cost you a hundred G's

CHORUS [Static]
I am music
I'm melodies, harmonies
Stereo and mono, on the radio, the radio
I said I am music
Simply dope beats
Intros and drumb rolls, on the radio, the radio

[Static]
I'll meet ya at a summer jam summer jam
I'm with you PM or AM
I'll work out with you when you're at the gym at the gym
And when you clean the house I'll be in den coz I am

CHORUS [Timbaland and Static]
I am music
Melodies, harmonies
Mono, stereo, ohhhhhhhhhhh
I am music
Simply dope beats
Tempos and drumb rolls, ohhhhhhhhh

[Aaliyah]
You may find me at shopping malls
I'm not buying, but I'll be for sale
I'll be your feeling when you talent shows
You might hear me at restaurants coz I am

CHORUS [repeat chorus 2]
